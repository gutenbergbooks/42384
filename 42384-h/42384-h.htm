<div class="center"><span class="smcap">To My Scandinavian Friends, Now Residents of the Puget
Sound Country:</span></div>

<p>Ten years have now elapsed since the "Scandinavians on
the Pacific" was published, and inasmuch as I now have the opportunity
of inserting a few pages, outlining in brief some of
the changes that are manifest since the publication of the book,
I deem it proper to do so.</p>

<p>"Scandinavians on the Pacific" was my first literary effort.
Some of the verses contained in the book were written in a hasty
manner, hence found it advisable to rewrite them, coining them
into better and more uniform metre, and later they appeared in
my book of poems, "Echoes from Dreamland," which may be
found in the Seattle Public Library, in the library of the University
of Washington, and in the libraries of Eastern universities
and colleges.</p>

<p>The opportunity of outlining the interesting changes that
have taken place in that period, and being enabled to make the
addition a part of the original book, comes to me by the generous
suggestion of Mr. F. P. Searle, Manager of the Ballard
Office of The Scandinavian American Bank, Ballard Station,
Seattle, Washington, as it is Mr. Searle's intention to present
the book to all of his Scandinavian customers and friends.</p>

<p>In the year 1899, while completing the history contained in
the original part of this book, I could not have conceived of the
wonderful changes that have been made throughout the whole
Northwest, and more particularly in the City of Seattle. During
the time I was writing the book, one of my very pleasant headquarters
was The Scandinavian American Bank, then located
at the corner of First Avenue and Yesler Way, in the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">[Pg VI]</a></span>
that is now occupied by the State Bank of Seattle, and it is a
source of a great deal of satisfaction to me, that with a few exceptions,
all the officers and employees of The Scandinavian
American Bank are still with the grand institution, which has
developed from a very modest bank of that date, into one of the
largest and most successful banking institutions in the State of
Washington.</p>

<p>First in my mind is Mr. Andrew Chilberg, to whom I dedicated
this book, and mentioned at the time that he was President
of the bank, and can still make the statement that he occupies the
same honored position; also Mr. James F. Lane, Cashier, and
quite a number of the old time employees. Mr. A. H. Soelberg,
however, is now connected with the State Bank of Seattle, in
the capacity of Vice President and Cashier.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to confine the additional pages
wholly to The Scandinavian American Bank; but the associations
were so pleasant, that it naturally comes to my mind in a
very vivid way, and before I leave the subject entirely, I wish to
speak of John Edward Chilberg, who at the time the book was
published, was known only as being an energetic business man,
in common with a great many others then residing in Seattle.
He is now the Vice President of The Scandinavian American
Bank, and the most of his success has been to the benefit of
Seattle, as it was through his foresight and faith in the future
development of this city that he brought about the erection of
the first sky scraper, which is the Alaska Building, and the present
home of the Scandinavian American Bank, and it was
through his energy that such a large proportion of Alaska's resources
were obtained for Seattle.</p>

<p>In looking at his picture, as one of the Chilberg family, representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">[Pg VII]</a></span>
four generations, which is found on page 48, it would
indeed be a shrewd judge of appearances that could have foreseen
the success that this man has made for himself, and for
Seattle.</p>

<p>Without going into details of the many enterprises that he
was identified with, which represent some of the finest improvements
in Seattle, I will close my autobiographical sketch of Mr.
Chilberg, by calling attention to the successful way that he managed
the affairs of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition, as
President of that successful Fair, and all Scandinavians residing
in this wonderful part of the United States, can feel justifiably
proud of the fact that it was a descendant of their race who had
so much to do with the wonderful improvements that have been
evidence in Seattle during the past ten years, and it is indeed a
pleasure for me to place his picture at this day and date along
with those of other prominent Scandinavians.</p>

<p>One of the most wonderful changes in Seattle is the gigantic
regrade work, which in a short time will so change the topography
of the city, that residents who left the city ten years ago,
would on their return, have hard work in locating old land marks.
I understand that to take the United States as a whole, this city
is one of the best advertised cities west of Chicago, and one cannot
visit any other city without being made aware that the majority
of the people know all about Seattle. Of course these
reports must be of recent date, as the "Alaska-Yukon-Pacific
Exposition" was the real advertising factor, as it certainly was
the most grandly arranged, and most successful fair that it has
ever been my privilege to see.</p>

<p>As I look through this book, written so many years ago, I
am made aware of the old time citizens who have been called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">[Pg VIII]</a></span>
Home, yet feel that all who have not had opportunity to read
the early history of the Scandinavians in this part of the country,
will derive a great deal of pleasure in being able to refresh their
memories, and to those Scandinavians who have recently settled
in this part of the country, the book will no doubt be the means
of many re-unions of friendship formed in other parts of the
world.</p>

<p>In concluding this short sketch, permit me to add "Greetings
from Puget Sound," a poem which I wrote some months
ago, and which was published on a post card, and copyrighted
by The Scenic Library Company.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>On solicitation of prominent Scandinavian-Americans, a
year ago, I undertook to write a volume or two, entitled,
"Scandinavians on the Pacific." At the launching of this
idea an untold number rallied around me with sweet tongues,
but many who pretended to furnish historical data
fabricated delusive smiles of impertinent selfishness. Others,
however, have been frank in ushering kind assistance. The
author is indebted to the following gentlemen for willing
advice and information: John Blaauw, Editor of Tacoma
Tidende, Tacoma; George Bech, Author of "Hæng Ham,"
etc., Seattle; Rev. T. J. Moen, Fairhaven, and N. P. Leque,
Stanwood.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="center"><em>From "An Ode to the Land of the Vikings."</em>&mdash;<em>Stine.</em></div>

<p>The author does not aim to lift the Scandinavians into
an air of ungained merit, he does not aim to clothe them with
undeserved encomium, but seeks to paint their dues in a
straightforward way, thoughtless of sailing the sea of hyperbole,
or entering any strait of unearned exploit.</p>

<p>In order, however, to give the reader a clear conception
of the spirit, the intrepidity, the characteristic worth of the
northern peoples, my pen cannot refrain from plowing into
the annals of the past. History is plain and authentic on
the subject, and the same chivalric blood ebbs through the
veins of the Vikings today as of yore. They have shared
and do share the burdens of adventure, discovery and colonization.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
They have nurtured their sons and daughters with
patriotic zeal, and unfurled to their love the folds of freedom.
They have braved the foam-crest waves minus compass and
sympathy&mdash;stars of night and sun of day guided them over
the traceless billows. Their dauntless sails have wafted in
sun and storm from shore to shore and woven together distant
climes.</p>

<p>From the dawn of navigation and soldiery the Scandinavians
have evinced skill and dexterity, filled with a whim
to roam, see and conquer. They were, perhaps, sometimes
rough in their daring expeditions, but always actuated with a
will to plant the scepter of liberty and to raise the standard
of civilization.</p>

<p>In 860 the valorous Naddodd discovered Iceland, and
fourteen years later a republic form of government was established,
which flourished four centuries. In 984 Erik The Red
discovered Greenland, and in the name of his native country,
Norway, took possession of the frozen territory, and unfolded
to the breeze the banner of liberty.</p>

<p>"To the West! To the West!" thought Leif Erikson,
son of Erik The Red, "spite waves and breakers," and in the
year 1000 pointed the bow of his bark for the shore of America,
landed at Helluland, now known as Newfoundland. He
reconnoitered the coast as far south as Massachusetts, and
christened the New World, <em>Vinland</em>.</p>

<p>Not here do the Vikings stop. In 1002 Thorwald Erikson
set sail for Vinland, spent three years exploring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
green-clad banks of New England with zealous desire to
unveil to his countrymen the characteristic features of the
new possession. In a collision with the Skrællings (Indians)
his precious life was blown out, the first European to succumb
to the arrows of the red race.</p>

<p>Not here do their voyages for the New World cease.
The sagas plainly picture their pilgrimages across the howling
waste for Vinland in 1005, 1007, 1011, 1121, 1347.</p>

<p>True, the Scandinavians have been heroes on sea, but no
less so on land. King Gustavus Adolphus, of Sweden, poured
his life blood on the battlefield of Lutzen, not for military
glory, but to liberate millions of innocent souls from the fire
of tyranny, the poisonous hands of the chief of superstition,
the narrow-minded Philip II., of Spain. He was not only a
military genius but the father of his people, a benefactor of
humanity.</p>

<p>In 1638 a company of Swedes colonized in the New
World, who made the hills and forests of Delaware ring
with the music of their picks and axes. As years rolled
by emigration started from Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
The wilderness of America was their object, the
building of homes their love. They braved the interior,
fought the lion and the bear, conquered the frowning
forests and subdued the spreading prairies. First huts of
logs and sods, then quaint dwellings rose to mark their
energy. Fields and gardens smiled, school-houses reared
the air, and happy lads and lasses pranced their way to school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
to drink freely from the fountain of knowledge. Home,
sweet home echoed from rocks and trees. The frontier was
their chance, and thither they steered their lots. They knew
how to swing the axe and use the hoe, climb mountains and
make themselves contented in the most hazardous exposure.</p>

<p>What to them the soft pillow? when a stone was near at
hand. They slept under the blue sky and drank health from
the floating clouds. A home for my son and daughter, or my
sweetheart, gave them fresh courage. Not only a home, but a
pleasant home in a congenial clime, where the heaven smiles
serenely, where the rose-bud bursts and thrives the year
round. Thunder and cyclones had shaken their tranquility.
More peaceful air, tired of the friction and disagreement in
the upper regions, and fire that seems eager to eat the whole
firmament. Away from the boisterous thunderbolts which
make it a business to blast and burn every cloud. "To the
West! Sweet Westland!" rolled in their souls, where the air
is pure, where the birds sing, where the scenery is grand.</p>

<h2>THE PACIFIC COAST.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"><span class="small">CHAPTER I.</span></a></h2>

<p>High and noble stands the Rocky, looking downward,
where jeweled brows hang, where silvery waves make music
on the deep, or the sea maid shakes her streaming locks. As
early as 1513 the brave Balboa hurled his exploring eyes over
the watery waste and in the name of Spain declared the discovery
of the mighty ocean. But, alas! the valorous Spaniard
received only scoff and scorn for his adventure and hardship,
and at last the cold world saw fit to lead him to the judgment
block for the unknown depth beyond.</p>

<p>A later date, in 1592, Juan de Fuca, a Greek pilot, in
the service of Spain, discovered the beautiful strait which
bears his name, the gateway to the picturesque Puget Sound.
In 1789 Captain Kendrick, an American explorer, was reconnoitering
along the Pacific coast, entered the Strait of Fuca,
steered his boat into the Strait of Georgia and Queen Charlotte
Sound, and depicted the characteristic features of the
land-locked waters. In 1804 the United States government
sent the Lewis and Clark expedition across the Rocky to
ascertain more minutely as to the climate and the feasibility
for settlement.</p>

<p>When the country was explored, and a sprinkling of
pioneers had spread themselves in the most favorable localities,
tidings of the complication between our government
and Great Britain reached them. War clouds were hanging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in the air prognostic of determining the ownership of their
terra firma. An amicable settlement, however, was brought
about and the present boundary between Washington and
British Columbia was fixed.</p>

<p>A petition was sent to Congress praying for closer
relationship in the Union, and in 1853 the Territory of
Oregon was organized. The flux of immigration fast settled
the attractive sylva on the Sound and the rolling prairies
east of the Cascades. The Territory being too large, and
the country north of Columbia was sliced off and made to
struggle for itself. The promoters of the scheme were vigilant
and got things to move their own way, and after all,
they didn't do anything worse than to give this vigorating
child of Uncle Sam the ever-cherished appellation <em>Washington</em>.</p>

<p>The scenery of Washington is grand and inviting. The
Cascade runs through the bosom of the state, cutting her in
twain, and throws his rugged spurs into Oregon and California.
The majestic Rainier rears through the clouds to
a height of 14,444 feet, wearing a hood of perpetual snow,
which changes to a verdant fringe as it runs downward, clothing
his feet with evergreen. Mount Adams has pushed his
head upward 12,902 feet, and Baker has reached an elevation
of 10,814, while St. Helen stopped 9750 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>To the westward is a less conspicuous attraction, the
Coast Range, which skirts the ocean and varies in height
from 3000 to 4000 feet. Between these mountain ranges
sweeps a fertile basin, carpeted with an unparalleled forest,
fir, cedar, spruce and hemlock rise skyward to a skeptical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
giddiness. Some stretch their forms 300 feet into the air.
Logs are piled upon one another, sleeping like angry mammoths
at the feet of gigantic trees. The more tender
offsprings shoot up between these lazy monsters, and some
take delight to grow on their decaying frames.</p>

<p>The fjords of Norway are sublime, and Puget Sound is
equally so. What can be more soul-stirring and soul-inspiring
than a merry sheet of water rippling for hundreds of miles
into a land of verdure, making sweet music day and night?
What can be more angelic and soothing to the soul than the
songs of the waves? Where can you find more poesy than
in the pearl-set crests rolling like melted gold upon gilded
pebbles? A clittering, clattering steal through the air, even
in the calm of night dulcet strains come to cheer the ear. A
soft whisper seems to spring from every flower. The forest
is alive with melodies, hills and mountains echo back the
harps of the deep.</p>

<p>Rivers and falls are no less sublime than the Sound, and
compare in grandeur with the famous streams and cataracts of
Switzerland and Scandinavia. The Columbia ranks with the
most picturesque rivers in the world, being of great value to
commerce, fleets of steamers ride on its bosom day and night
with merchandise from foreign climes, and grain, fruit and
other produce raised west of the Rocky. Snoqualmie, Snohomish,
Skagit and others are also navigable and invite the
attention of wonder-seekers.</p>

<p>Snoqualmie fall is one of nature's masterpieces, and bespeaks
grandeur and sublimity. The water shoots into the
air, tumbles down a royal precipice, whirls, foams and
splashes, fills heaven with thunder and the soul with awe and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
admiration. The Tumwater fall is likewise grand and awe-inspiring,
stunning in music and bewitching in scenery.</p>

<p>Storms seldom visit the Pacific, and thunder rarely finds
a rich medium in the balmy clouds. But, terror! when a
storm is propagated on yonder deep, and sets the ocean boiling
and shivering up shallow bays, and springs into the forest
like an unchained demon, then the whole heaven shakes and
trembles. Firs and cedars tumble like dead giants, knocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
each other to the ground in the fashion of heartless heathens.
Blasts upon blasts swell through the air and roll along the
mountain ridges not dissimilar to Jove's chariot.</p>

<p>Ay, you speak of awe and fright when a prairie fire gets
sway on the Central Plain, but when the guest of good and
evil gains access to the Washington forest in the month of
August or September a hell is witnessed similar to that
painted by ranting trumpeters. Flames rise skyward and
with the aid of winds set the trees flaring and howling as in
the clutches of a thousand devils.</p>

<p>The fertility of the Pacific forest is something incredulous,
the quantity and quality of lumber produced are astounding
to all not familiar with this country. Even a conservative
estimate would make many curious speculators drunk with
figures.</p>

<p>In the State of Washington forests spread over thirteen
million acres of land. West of the Cascades is a stretch of
ten million, clothing hills and dells from Canada to Columbia
river with valuable fir, cedar, spruce, pine, hemlock and tamarack,
while on the east side three million acres of forest land
are scattered along the rivers and mountain slopes.</p>

<p>Saw mills and shingle factories are being kept busy the
year round. More than one billion feet of lumber are turned
out annually and shipped to all parts of the globe. The
shingle industry is something phenomenal. Factories are
whistling and piping everywhere throughout the cedar districts,
and thousands of men find lucrative employments.</p>

<p>Mining is an important pursuit, rugged brows smile with
independent richness. Moss-bearded ledges of the precious
metal run into the heart of the Cascades. The Index districts
teem with mineral wealth, and Lake Chelan shines with
doubtless yields. Iron ore rests in the bosom of the Sound
country from the green feet of old Rainier to the dashing
waves of the Pacific. As you cross the divide for Eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Washington, you find paying veins running in different directions.
Coal is a natural consequence, which in no manner
puzzles the minds of geologists. From days of yore luxuriant
vegetation has robed plains and valleys to impenetrable
density. The death of rich forests has built beds of astonishing
thickness, and the formation of coal has resulted to a
marked degree.</p>

<p>Agriculture and horticulture invite attention. The rolling
prairies between the Rocky and the Cascades are especially
adapted for the raising of cereals. Wheat yields from 50 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
75 bushels per acre, oats from 100 to 125, rye from 60 to 80.
Irrigation has been practiced with wonderful success around
Wenatchee. The feasibility of applying nature itself is
remarkable. Here and there meander silvery streams of clear
water, which are made to spread over fertile tracts of land at
any time, and to any part wanted. No longing for showers to
quench and sweeten the thirsty soil bothers the farmer in this
section. Irrigation is so easily practiced, and the crops thus
raised are so enormous, may it be grain or fruit, that the eastern
agriculturist cannot conceive our natural advantages.
Why linger on the hungry prairies of the east, freezing your
lives out, when opportunities like these are extended to you?
Here you can get a pleasant home, for a small trifle, where
the air is mild and soothing, where the soil is rich and easily
cultivated.</p>

<p>The Sound country is equally productive. Ay, inexhaustible.
The Washington fruit is known the world over
for quality and quantity. Magnificent orchards adorn every
farm, and the smaller ranches, too, enjoy the presence of
wealthy apple, pear and plum trees.</p>

<p>When you throw your eye upon Puget Sound, and behold
the fleet of fish barges, rolling upon it's briny breast, a reminiscence
of the coast of Norway steals into your soul.
Cohorts of men, mostly Scandinavians, resort to the waves
for subsistence. Herring and salmon throng the water in
rich abundance. Shoals of the latter race along the shores,
fighting their way up streams to spawn. Some become savory
prey for bears, cougars and wolves, others die a respectable
death, or return to their natural abode&mdash;the ocean. The halibut
plays master among the smaller species, and grows fat at
their diminution. He cares nothing for streams or shallow
bays, but gambols friskily amidst the salty billows.</p>

All the gold and silver in the bowels of the earth, and all
the glittering nuggets shining on her bosom did not ruffle the
serenity, or affect the wonted vagrancy of the Indians. To
them the forest was a nuisance and the saw mill a scarecrow.
The singing brook was worthless and the rolling river valueless,
save as mothers of trout. They had no love for higher
aspiration, no instinct for advancement, no aim to better their
condition, no foresight to provide against the pitiless influence
of cold or heat, no sagacity, no frugality, no thought of tomorrow,
no pile of subsistence for a rainy day or helpless age,
troubled their minds. Life was to them a ceaseless dream of
nothingness. Superstition was their god and pride, reason a
casual stranger which rooted not in their souls.</p>

<p>What has changed this sad drudgery of the Indians to a
social commonwealth? What has spurned the fiend of superstition
to a shameful death? What has invited reason and
common sense to dwell peacefully in our hearts? What has
lifted the world from the thorny plane of priesthood? What
has wrested from the priestly hand the scepter of government?
Our forefathers knew it and provided for its development.
The pioneers of Washington had tested it, and prescribed it
for the coming generations. The log schoolhouse rose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
their sweet recollection of childhood days, then a frame building,
then a brick edifice. High schools were established, a
state university was erected, normal schools were founded, an
agricultural college and school of science was built.</p>

<p>No class of people or nation deserves the title, cosmopolitan,
better than the Vikings. Their names mingle with
the history of England, France, Russia and Italy, and in the
Western Hemisphere we find them all over. To trace up the
first Scandinavian that touched the shore of Washington is
difficult, if not impossible. No doubt but Scandinavians
made stoppings along the coast on their fishing expeditions
to the north before any white man had dreamt to pin his hopes
to the North Pacific. And it is probable, too, that some adventurous
spirit of Viking blood had been washed with
American polish, and passed as a Yankee in the Lewis and
Clark expedition. It is safe to conjecture, however, that
some straggler from the sea-beaten shores of Scandinavia
shared the sufferings with the trappers of the Hudson Bay
Company, or partook of the hardships in John Jacob Astor's
expeditions for the mouth of Columbia river. These companies
were made up of heterogeneous crews. The mercurial
French Canadian, the acute Yankee, the jolly Englishman,
the stern German, joined hands for the furfields, and it seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
reasonable that some hardy Scandinavian, too, was likely to
abandon his fireside, turn his back on civilization, and yield
consent to a more romantic life.</p>

<p>A motley combine known as the Russian Fur Company
had established an emporium on the Pacific coast, and a
number of trading posts in the interior, ere the close of the
eighteenth century, and it is authentically evidenced that
Scandinavians and Finlanders constituted the minor force of
the regiment of trappers and navigators. Let it suffice to
say, however, that these brave adventurers regardless of
genealogical type did much to sow information in the
Old World of the evergreen land west of the Rocky; and
suffer it to be known that the probability is that some intrepid
Scandinavian sacrificed his life in search for peltry, and that
his bones rest in peace beneath the green turf in the Pacific
forest. This brings us to the influx of permanent settlers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frederic Meyer.</span>&mdash;One of the first white women
that breathed the air of Pierce county was Mrs. Frederic
Meyer, a Norwegian by birth. She left her mother's hearth
in Toten while a tender bud, fresh as a rose with blooms of
white and purple blushing on her cheeks. Few women are
of true romantic nature, their hearts, as a rule, are attached
to social affiliation around the fireside, but Mrs. Meyer figures
as a typical exception. Those that have known her well
speak with kind tongues, pronouncing her a model of her sex,
chivalric in spirit, and brave, but warm at heart. According
to reliable information obtained in Tacoma, she lit her feet

looms, forty odd years ago. She was married to an estimable

in Denmark, and from childhood showed an insatiable
passion for the sea, which ripened into irresistible lust.
While a lad of vernal years he left his native seat to be
dashed on the briny waves from port to port. He saw the
crystal ice of Lofoten, the huge glaciers of Greenland, the
thirsty greens of India, the foul bogs of China, the flowery
vales of Japan, the rich gold fields of Australia, the teeming
meadows of New Zealand. He was tossed from continent to
continent, from island to island. About forty-five years ago
he drifted ashore near Port Discovery, and under veil of night
put wings to his feet for the forest. The fascinating aspect
of the country and the aromatic sylva poured streams of delight
into his soul. As he stood in the early morn, gazing
around in mingled awe and admiration, he was surrounded by
a red race, who, at first, gave vent to the horrible dilemma of
converting his heart to ashes or treating him as a slave, but
his ingenious demeanor turned their sanguinity to laughter,
and Anderson became their curious jocularity which melted
to favoritism. He strolled with the train of vagabonds alternately
fishing and hunting up streams and canoeing the
Sound. Thus ten years were dragged out of his longevity
without mingling with white men.</p>

<p>His longing for civilization vanished little by little, and the
life of celibacy settled heavily on his heart. He was a friend
of the chief and an admirer of his daughter, and it took only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the big canoe to seal the bargain. Anderson was rather long-headed
for the red heathens, and got the best of every deal.
He was now the possessor of the biggest canoe, save the royal
ship, and was looked upon as independently opulent. Only a
word would change his life for better or worse. Finally he
took the delicate step and offered the huge dug-out in trade
for the young princess, which was accepted with loud eclat.</p>

<p>The ban of the nuptial day was made public. The bride
spared no tiptoeing to make it highly royal. First was a coat
of red paint, then purple, tinged with green. A carefully administered
shampoo of oil followed, then a crands of wild
flowers was critically twined to her wealth of black locks with
a few quills set on end in the most confused bewilderment.
Of course, Anderson did not fancy the odorous coat of his intended,
nor her pert of etiquette, but being as those things
were incidental to the dynasty, he darted approbation with his
blue eyes, thinking, "Costume is not permanent."</p>

<p>From this time the chivalric Dane became a leader. He
piloted the royal squadron to Hood's Canal, where he squatted
on a piece of land, hence the sobriquet&mdash;Hood's Canal Anderson.</p>

<p>He became attached to his wife, and she reciprocated with
equal depth of conjugality, and shaped her costume to meet his
liking, yet Uncle Sam pried into their warm nestling by passing
a law to either separate or marry according to his code. Of
course, Anderson had to marry his wife the second time, which
he did like a loyal citizen. He took his corpulent queen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
placed her in the stern of the big canoe, and paddled to Seabold,
where they were united in holy ties by Harry Shafer,
Uncle Sam's matrimonial agent. Anderson bears the honor
of being the first white man on Puget Sound concubined to a
squaw in accordance with the laws of the United States. He
was industrious and elevated compared with his station, turned
a wooded bit of ground to a flowery garden, and in a corner, beneath
a weedy sod, he rests unsung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Friberg.</span>&mdash;Peter Friberg, like Hood's Canal Anderson,
has walked the highway of frontier trials. He was born in
Sweden, but when a mere youth sought the waves. After
years of trying experiences he found himself on Puget Sound,
among the floating Flatheads, about the same time Anderson
landed, but perchance drifted off with another flock of red skins,
consequently the two contemporaries were ignorant of
each other's wanderings till later years, when they accidently
met and shook hands.</p>

<p>Peter Friberg also threw his heart to a squaw, and with her
he barged along the shores making depredation on salmon and
halibut, finally pinning his future to a happy point running
into the bosom of the Sound, near Salmon Bay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin Toftezen.</span>&mdash;About two-and-forty years ago, a son
of Norway anchored his canoe on the north side of Whidbey
Island. His name has been pinned to its soil among the first
on record. He was a pioneer of heart and courage&mdash;chivalrous
Martin Toftezen. He had drifted around the Horn on a ship,
and was tossed into the mouth of Puget Sound, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
breath of the deep calmed to a gentle zephyr, and the wings of
speed flapped in disconsolation. The bark was dashed ashore
by the angry billows, caused by the agitating tide, and Toftezen
stood in a transport of mingled awe and perturbation.
Nature was grand, enchantingly sang the ripples up the fascinating
arm, and mad in grandeur reared the snow-capped
peaks, flinging smiles of welcome. "Why reject the poetic
landscape? Nature's sweetness will smite the blue forehead
of dreary solitude." These thoughts rolled in his fancy, and
up the Sound he paddled, and settled on the green tail, where
he wore out his life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Andrias Peterson.</span>&mdash;No man on the Pacific coast
ever endured more hardships than the personage in question&mdash;Peter
Andrias Peterson&mdash;who, about a year ago fell prey to
an incidental injury, and was carried over the stream for the
unknown sea beyond.</p>

<p>He was born in Denmark, 1828, and cast on the cold billows
to struggle for himself at the age of fifteen. A few years
later he stepped ashore in England, where he took a course in
navigation to enable himself to cope more successfully with
the foam-crest surges. He embarked a ship for India and
Australia. In the latter place his mind was engrossed with exciting
reports from the gold fields, and thither he flew, a fugitive
of the sea. Success smiled on his brow, and wealth crowded
into his hands; but riches easily won are not highly treasured.
In a wildcat scheme he sunk his fortune, and before the dawn
of a fresh week his thousands were in the hands of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
This catastrophe, brought about by sheer mishap, drove
him back to the sea, and, in 1859, landed at Victoria, British
Columbia. A buoyant spirit, though wounded with ill-luck, will
soar to felicity and breathe vigor on green fields. Peterson was
delighted with the verdure that greeted his vision, and took a
canoe excursion around the Sound. On returning to Victoria,
he was struck with the gold fever which raged desperately in
the Cascades and Sound country. He compromised with his
floating thoughts, bent his energy on a prospecting tour,
and in two days flocked together sixteen men. In his
customary adroitness he took command of the little army
of gold seekers, and bore into the forest, but when two
hundred and twenty-five miles from Victoria, thirteen of them
lost courage and returned to the city.</p>

<p>Peterson and his two companions proceeded up a small
stream for some days, and to their astonishment, one gray
evening, fell upon four white men actively engaged in picking
gold nuggets. They staked out a claim, glimpses of luck
commenced to play on their cheeks, but died ere a fortnight
had gone to rest in the pensive dream of growing forgetfulness.
Their ration was getting low, and to save themselves from falling
victims to pitiless starvation, they raked together their
pelf, and returned to Victoria.</p>

<p>In the spring an English syndicate mustered a regiment of
fresh recruits, a man of spirit and agility was wanted to head
an expedition into the mountains, and Peterson was offered the
responsibility, as he had already gained fame as a daring adventurer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
It was suggested to seek a new field, and a guide
was secured to usher them along. First, however, was to
hunt up an easy pass, and to accomplish this, a knot of fourteen
men, headed by Peterson, was dispatched into the wilderness.
They fought their way through murky vales and
climbed moss-bearded brows, the day sunk behind the horizon
and night wrapped them in darkness. Thus they continued;
but, alas! the guide disappears. The others rambled through
treacherous woods, thoughtless of any hazard. Hours were
consumed climbing over angry logs and chasing through
witching dingles, but the guide was neither heard nor sighted.</p>

<p>The thirteen brave were lost in the forest where gloomy
giants stretched into a ghastly stillness, broken only by
deceiving owls sailing over their heads on disconsolate wings.
For eight days they wandered without a morsel to eat; grouse
and pheasant were drumming through the air, and deer gambolled
in listless droves, but only to whet their keen appetite.
Their fire-locks were empty like their stomachs.</p>

<p>After darkness comes sunshine, and to their exhileration
tumbled into an unknown mining camp. They were received
as friends and immediately treated to a savory table. One of the
unfortunates being so greedy for the palatable viands that he
rose in the night to gormandize a heap of pan-cakes, left from
supper, and shortly after fell juicy feed for the grave and
worms.</p>

<p>A new plan was formulated, two Scotchmen were sent
back to Victoria for provision, and the others remained at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
camp. A couple of months elapsed, and twenty-four miners
halted at the gold-seeking hamlet where the unlucky retinue
joined them.</p>

<p>The company, now numbering thirty-four, resumed their
pilgrimage in an easterly direction for nearly two hundred
miles. The landscape swept up into jutting brows and gray-headed
peaks, and the forest fringed into a scabby shrub of
hungry appearance. The change in nature cast cold currents
into their souls, but soon melted into delight. A beautiful
stream grated their ears, and thither they flocked.</p>

<p>Nature was now sweetness and grandeur, and fortune
seemed to smile from every leaf and twig. The blue heaven
hung over them, here and there dipped with shades of purple;
the sun sent down his wealth of beams to kiss their hardy
cheeks; and the clear stream was busy making music as it
tumbled down jeweled precipices to swell the deep. They
drank hope and aspiration from the poetic environment, and
each, as a loyal soldier, embarked his assigned duty with
happiness in his heart. Gold was not doubted, before a month
had slipped away, the precious metal glittered in rich veins.</p>

<p>A frontier mining camp, in the heart of savages, is a continuous
scene of sunshine and storm, of joy and despair. Precaution
must be the watchword of every individual, early and
late; a careless step might betray them to the altar of cruel
slaughter. The book-keeper had been appointed custodian of
the fire arms, who, in a thoughtless way, or to satisfy his
greed, bargained the ammunition to the Indians. Oh, terror!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the happy camp was turned to a lake of blood. One sad
night, in the early part of winter, the savages stealthily fell
upon the camp, and like thieves entered the lodges, pointed
their ill-gotten fire-pieces against innocent breasts, and
quenched the light within.</p>

<p>Peterson and two Scotchmen escaped the murderous
fire, naked they ran, not dissimilar to deer over the snow,
the former dashed into the river where ten thousand pug
devils, sitting in its bosom, bleeded his feet, and the latter
chased down the bank of the stream as in an elopement
from hell. After a month of severest suffering and hardship
they reached the gate of safety&mdash;Victoria&mdash;blood-stained
and scraggy, hardly able to combat the icy angel
of death. The gold fever had ceased to ebb through their
veins. The two Scotchmen returned to their dear fatherland,
and Peterson built a boat and sailed for Stillaguamish
where he sleeps in peace under the green turf, three miles
from Stanwood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred Landstone.</span>&mdash;In Swedish, Fredrik Landsten,
a man of nomadic spirit and fine intellect, was born in
Sweden, and in the spring of manhood ascended the horizon
of sea-faring exploits. In 1860 he landed at San
Francisco, and a year later stept ashore at Port Discovery,
Washington. A score of years on the rolling brine had
changed his mind for terra firma. He resorted to logging
camps and saw mills, working hard until 1876, when he
retired on a piece of land three miles from Poulsbo, where
he still resides, slowly wearing out the balance of his
years.</p>

under the illustration).&mdash;White with a wealth of snowy
locks, and seven-and-four scores of years hanging on his
back, yet nimbly he frisks about on his beautiful farm
at Pleasant Ridge, Skagit county. This aged pioneer of
unusual endurance and grit, keen intellect and warm soul,
was born in Halland, near Laholm, Sweden, 1813, came to
America, 1846, and located in Iowa. In 1860 he visited
Pike's Peak, Colorado, and in 1863 left his family again, a
loving wife and children, for the West with a view to find a
more congenial clime. For some time he traveled in Montana,
crossed the Rocky, and came to Puget Sound, 1865.
The sweet-scenting forest and the balmy heaven awakened
his love for perambulation of the Pacific, from British Columbia
to the Golden State. He resolved to make his future
abode west of the Cascades, and in 1869 returned to Iowa to
remove his family to Washington, arriving at Pleasant
Ridge the following spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. Charles John Chilberg and three of her sons, Joseph,
John H. and Charles F., came to the Pacific in the spring of
1871, and Isaac and B. A. a few months later. James P.
Chilberg has climbed the horizon of pioneer adventures. In
1859 he landed in California, in 1864 traveled in Oregon, and
in 1870 beheld the rippling Sound and the Washington forest.
In 1872 Nelson Chilberg took a survey of the Pacific and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
three years subsequent his brother Andrew threw his eyes
upon the mighty ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew Nelson.</span>&mdash;A jolly fellow, familiarly known as
Dogfish Nelson, was among the first Scandinavian pioneers.
He was born in Denmark, 1832, and landed as a sailor at
Port Ludlow in 1867. Like many others he was attracted
by the country, and to drive away monotony took an
Indian woman for wife, as white women were almost
unknown on the coast at that time. Nelson has encountered
many obstacles in his cruising among the red skins
and fierce brutes, but always managed to play the hero.
He has been industrious and convivial, and a flowery nest
in Brown's Bay bespeaks his rank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans Hansen</span>, a Dane, who resides at Alki Point,
near Seattle, has earned a footing among the early Scandinavian
pioneers. His years on the Pacific reach pretty
nigh two scores. Knut Knutson, a native of Norway, and
also a resident of Alki Point, came to Puget Sound over
thirty years ago, and has passed through days of sun and
storm. C. E. Norager, likewise of Norse birth, places his
disembarkation on the Pacific about forty years back.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS IN SEATTLE.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span></a></h2>

<p>Seattle, the metropolis of Washington, and the busiest
city on the Pacific coast, has a romantic history, as well as
a history of thrift and progress. Thirty-five years ago
only a few log cabins set on the shore of Elliott Bay,
inhabited by a handful of pioneers. Bears and cougars
danced around their huts, and Indians skulked in lazy
hordes at their threshold. How changed! today the Queen
city is spread over about fifty square miles of land, overlooking
the melodious Puget Sound, and dots the green
borders of three fresh-water lakes with snug cottages.
She has a population of about 85,000, of which a large per
cent are Scandinavians.</p>

The first Scandinavian that visited Elliott Bay, of which
we have any authentic account, was Peter Friberg, formerly
mentioned. Shortly after came C. E. Norager and others
referred to in the previous chapter. Charles John Chilberg
made a survey of the bay in 1865, when only a saw mill and
a sprinkling of shanties marked the presence of white men.
In 1869, Edward Gunderson, a native of Norway, crossed the
Rocky to make Seattle his future habitation, which was then
in its early embryo. The same year, Amund Amunds, born
in Racine county, Wis., of Norwegian parents, removed to
the city from Cowlitz county where he had disembarked two
years prior. Amunds grew opulent and invited the love of
all his associates. He was director and first vice-president of
the Scandinavian American Bank of Seattle, and heavily
interested in real estate. He was an energetic worker in the
Ancient Order of United Workmen, and received the highest
honor&mdash;Grand Receiver of the jurisdiction of Washington.
He died four years ago and his funeral was a solemn event.</p>

<p>In 1872, Nelson Chilberg, son of Charles John Chilberg,
made an appearance, and three years later his brother Andrew
was attracted to the coast, as referred to in the previous
chapter, and started the first Scandinavian store in Seattle,
in company with J. P. Chilberg. The prospect was glittering
and ere a year had died Nelson joined them in grocery
business, the firm being Chilberg Brothers. Andrew Chilberg
soon rose to popularity, became one of Seattle's most
prominent citizens, and an honor to the Scandinavians.</p>

<p>He was born in Laholm, Sweden, March 29, 1845. When
a lad of one year he crossed the Atlantic with his parents,
settling near Ottumwa, Iowa, where he received his early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
education in the common schools. In 1860 he left Ottumwa
with his father and older brother, Nelson, for Pike's Peak,
Colorado, remaining two years, then returned to Iowa. In
1863 he crossed the Rocky with a wagon train, arriving in
Sacramento after a journey of five months, September 24th.
His health was harassed by exposure and hardship in crossing
the plains, and as an alternative of recovery worked on
a farm two years. Mr. Chilberg was anxious to complete his
education, and in 1866 returned to Iowa via Nicaragua and
New York. After taking a course in college he obtained a
teacher's certificate and engaged in teaching, but abandoned
the profession after three years of successful experience to
enter a more lucrative position in Ottumwa. In 1857 he journeyed
to Seattle, where he still resides, embarking in grocery
business in company with his brother, the firm being Chilberg
Brothers. Three years subsequent to his arrival in the
city, he was elected to the city council, in 1879 appointed
vice-consul for Sweden and Norway, in 1882 chosen county
assessor, and in 1885 intrusted with the responsibility of city
treasurer. In 1886 he was named city passenger and ticket
agent for the Northern Pacific Railroad, but resigned, 1892,
to accept the presidency of the Scandinavian American Bank
of Seattle. In 1896 he was elected to the board of education,
and the following year assumed the presidential chair. He was
married to an estimable lady, Miss Mary Nelson, in Iowa,
November 5, 1874. They have one son, Eugene, who is a
young man of fine training, being educated in the Seattle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
High School, Washington Agricultural College and School of
Science, and Washington State University.</p>

<p>Peter Wickstrom.&mdash;With the first brigade of Scandinavians,
Peter Wickstrom marched in the front rank. He
was born in Sweden, 1837, arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota,
1868, and four years later beheld the city of Portland, Oregon,
and the same year located in Seattle.</p>

<p>Louis and Henry Peterson.&mdash;The Peterson brothers were
among the early Scandinavians and the first to engage in the
art of photography in the city of Seattle. They were born
in Norway but sailed for America while young boys, arriving
in Chicago, 1857, where they resided nineteen years,
leaving for Seattle, 1876.</p>

<p>Martin C. Mortensen.&mdash;Mortensen was a native of Denmark,
and arrived in Seattle the same year as the Peterson
brothers. He came to America, 1868, and two years later
landed in San Francisco, spending six years in that city,
then journeyed northward.</p>

<p>Christian C. Plough.&mdash;Vice-Consul Christian C. Plough
is one of Seattle's most highly respected citizens. He was
born in Denmark, 1825, and came to America, 1868, selecting
Chicago for his first stopping place, but after two months of
abode in the Windy City he removed to Nebraska, where he
stayed one year. The Pacific was his aim and thither he
went, disembarked in Olympia, via San Francisco by boat,
1872, where he remained three weeks. Portland, Oregon, had
attracted considerable attention as a city of business prospect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and Plough again picked together his effects to resume another
journey. He stayed in Portland three years then removed
to Seattle. In 1883 he was appointed vice-consul for
Denmark, served with honor until 1895 when he was compelled
to resign on account of ill health. Christian Geerstsen,
a man of honor and intelligence, came to America in company
with Plough, and also arrived in Seattle together. He was
born in Denmark, 1839.</p>

<p>Ben Jensen, now a resident of San Juan county, arrived
in Seattle when a dense forest clothed the principal streets.
He was born in Norway, came to America while a youth,
and has proved a worthy factor to his adopted country. Ole
Egge, also a native of Norway, has shared the hardships of
the early Pacific. He is a man of intelligence, and enjoys the
respect of his countrymen. His son Peter is a bright man of
mechanical ingenuity, and landed in Seattle with his parents.</p>

<p>In the more recent years, Scandinavians in Seattle have
made great progress in professional and business circles. In
politics, too, they have commanded notice, and in science and
letters attention. E. H. Evenson is the incumbent county
auditor, and H. P. Rude councilman-at-large.</p>

<p>E. H. Evenson was born at Whitewater, Wisconsin, in
the year 1852. His early life was spent on a farm in Waupaca
county, Wisconsin. At the age of 18 he began to teach
in the common schools in his neighborhood, and with the
money thus earned he started on a six years' course at Decorah
College, Iowa, from which he graduated in the spring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
'79. During all this time he taught common schools at intervals,
and during vacations worked in the harvest fields of
Minnesota and earned the money with which to pay his college
expenses. Having finished his course at Decorah College
he entered the State University of Wisconsin, from which he
graduated with the class of '81.</p>

<p>In the fall of the same year, Mr. Evenson secured a position
as teacher in Milton College, Milton, Wisconsin, where
he remained for three years; at the end of that period he removed
to Madison, South Dakota, to fill a place as teacher in
the State Normal School at that city, which position he occupied
for two years; he was then elected county superintendent
of schools for Lake county, in which capacity he served two
terms. At the close of the last term he made another move
west, to Puget Sound, and settled on 40 acres of land near the
town of Kent, where he now resides with his family. He
is at present serving his second term as auditor of King
county.</p>

<p>Mr. Evenson is a firm believer in the "single tax" theories
of Henry George; that is, in placing all taxes on ground
rents. The justice of that method, he claims, is based on the
following self-evident truths:</p>

<p>"1st: That whatever the individual produces, belongs to
the individual, and whatever the community produces, belongs
to the community.</p>

<p>"2d: That the general rise in land value, commonly
called ground rents, is caused by the growth of the community
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and its competition for work, and therefore, by right,
belongs to the community.</p>

<p>"3d: That, as taxes are needed for the welfare of the
community, it is only in accordance with natural and divine law
that the community makes use of this common fund before it
resorts to the confiscation of what properly belongs to the individual.</p>

<p>"4th: That it is not only unjust in principle, but injurious
to the last degree in practice, that one man is taxed more
for making land useful and employing labor on it, than another
is taxed for holding land idle and keeping labor off it.</p>

<p>"5th: That to tax labor or its products, is to discourage
industry.</p>

<p>"6th: That to tax land values to their full amount will
compel every individual controlling natural opportunities to
either utilize them by the employment of labor, or abandon
them to others; that it will thus provide opportunities of work
for all men, and secure to each the full reward of his labor."</p>

H. P. Rude, the fearless councilman-at-large, of Seattle,
was born in Toten, Norway, March 4, 1861. He graduated
from the public school at the age of fifteen, later took a course
in higher education at a private institution. From boyhood
he manifested native pluck which his career plainly reveals.
Unlike most boys, he spent his leisure studying and learning
the tailoring trade. Seeing that the seat of his birth
being too narrow for cosmopolitan development, he planned
for the national capital against the will of his father. In a
confidential manner he obtained two crowns from his grandfather,
and under veil of night walked forty-two miles, arriving
at Dahl Station, Eidsvold, at ope of dawn, from whence he took
the train to Christiania. Though only a youth of fifteen, he
found employment in a leading tailoring establishment, and
attended school during evenings. In 1881 he emigrated to
America, after making a short stop in Chicago, he proceeded
to Redwing, Minnesota, to visit relatives who lived fifteen
miles out in the country, in the state of Wisconsin. Unable
to articulate an English sentence, "but where there is a will
there is a way," crossed the river with an Indian, found the
road by means of a guide-post, and stalked the unknown distance.
After a pleasant reunion with friends and relatives, he
returned to Redwing, worked for some time at his trade, then
embarked in business for himself. His next move was to
Minneapolis, where he found employment in a fashionable
store. He joined the Tailors' Union, having a membership of
200, and within a year became its president, and subsequently
was chosen a delegate to the Trade and Labor Assembly. He
resigned from the Union to engage in business of his own
which he followed for some time. After disposing of his interests
in Minneapolis, he traveled in the surrounding cities, then
crossed the Rocky, arriving in Seattle, 1890, during the
transient boom of Anacortes, which attracted him to that place,
but returned to Seattle ere long. He worked for awhile as
cutter, then started a tailoring establishment of his own.</p>

<p>For years he had been alert to public affairs, and in 1896
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was elected councilman from the Sixth Ward, the fusion
stronghold, with a large majority. He was renominated by
the Republican party, but councilman-at-large, and elected
with an increased vote. On resignation of Mayor Wood, he
was instrumental in placing Judge Thomas J. Humes into the
mayor's chair. To the credit of Mr. Rude it must be said
that he has ascended to his political honors unsought, and
that his record is emblematic of honesty and ability. He has
been opposing the perpetuity of the gambling hells in the
lower strata of the city in such a manner that even his political
enemies had to commend his course. His famous resolution
made the tenderloin district shiver with fear, while
honest men and women bowed with gratitude. The following
is taken from a leading daily of Seattle:</p>

<p>"H. P. Rude, councilman-at-large, is entitled to great
credit for his endeavor to put a quietus to certain classes of
crime so often indulged in the various places of resort in the
lower part of the city."</p>

<p>Mr. Rude's influence among the members of the city
council is made conspicuous by his representation on the
several committees. He is chairman of the police license
and revenue committee, and a valuable member on the committees
of finance, corporation, labor, public buildings and
grounds, and harbor and wharf.</p>

<p>He was married, 1881, in Minnesota, to Miss Lina Sophia
Larsen, a lady of lofty character, to whom he was betrothed
in Norway. She was born in Eidswold, November 24, 1863,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of highly respected parents, and emigrated to America a few
months subsequent to the arrival of her husband. They have
four children, Henry M. Rude, born in Wisconsin, March 14,
1883. The other three are natives of Minnesota, George A.
Rude, born May 3, 1885, Lillie Palma Rude, February 24,
1887, and Morris O. Rude, April 10, 1889.</p>

<p>J. H. Ekstrand, a true son of Sweden, and an ex-minister
of the M. E. Church, is a Seattle pioneer. He came to the
United States more than two scores of years ago, and has been
influential in both church and political circles.</p>

<p>E. A. Seaburg, a native of Sweden, has likewise given
keen vigilance to public affairs, always a stalwart republican.
As regards men of scholarly attainment, Rev. M. A. Christensen
ranks among the most polished on Puget Sound. He
is an accomplished linguist and an eloquent pastor of the
Emmanuel Lutheran Church. H. M. Korstad, a graduate of
the University of Washington, is also master of several languages
and a deep student of ethics and psychology. He
was born in the United States, but his parents hail from Valders,
Norway. His sister, Bertha Korstad, is a prominent
teacher in the public schools of Kitsap county.</p>

<p>N. B. Nelson.&mdash;Very few have been more successful in
business than the personage in question&mdash;N. B. Nelson&mdash;of
the firm, Frederick, Nelson and Munro. He is a man of a
lucky mixture&mdash;business, integrity, and sociability. Mr.
Nelson was born in Kristianstad, Sweden, July 31, 1857, and
like most boys in that country received a thorough schooling.
From boyhood he had nursed a liking to see America, and in
1875 landed in Colorado, minus means, a stranger in a new
world, and worst of all unable to converse with the general
public, but picked up the language with marked rapidity.
He bent his energy to farming, following the pursuit for
several years in Garfield county, but at the same time gave
keen eye to public affairs, and served the people as county
commissioner for three years. His attention was engrossed
with the progress of the Pacific, and thither he journeyed,
1891, and shortly after embarked in furniture business on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Pike street in a store less than twenty by sixty. At present
the firm of Frederick, Nelson and Munro occupies the Rialto
Block, in the very heart of the city, covering 105,400 square
feet, more than two and a half acres of household goods.
The traffic of the firm is immense, exceeding every establishment
of its nature north of San Francisco. Mr. Nelson was
married, 1895, to an accomplished young lady, Miss Teckla
Johnson, born in Ronneby, Blekinge, Sweden. They have
two boys, Frederick Creigh Nelson and Chester Munro Nelson.</p>

<p>Axel H. Soelberg, bank cashier and a respected citizen of
Seattle, was born at Ness Hedemarken, Norway, on March 2,
1869. He received a common school education, graduating at
the age of fourteen. In 1884 he secured a position in the
store of Jevanord Brothers in Brumundalen, with whom he
remained until in the spring of 1888, when he emigrated for
America. He arrived in Minneapolis on the morning of May
17th. A short time previous, a number of Norwegian-American
citizens of Minneapolis had organized the State Sash
and Door Manufacturing Company, and Mr. Soelberg was
offered the position as book-keeper a few days after his arrival
in the city. He served in this capacity for about two years,
then was elected secretary of the firm, and two years later vice-president.
In the spring of 1892, when the Scandinavian American
Bank of Seattle was organized, he was tendered the
position as book-keeper in the bank, and accepting, Mr. Soelberg
found himself in Seattle on one of the first days in April
of that year. At the annual meeting in 1894, he was elected
cashier of the bank, which position he now holds. Mr. Soelberg
is a man of literary aptitude as well as of business
capacity, has contributed largely to the Seattle Daily Times
and other leading papers. He could have won laurels on the
field of letters as well as business notice in the world of traffic.
In January, 1898, he was married to Miss Olga Wickstrom,
an accomplished young lady of Seattle. They have a beautiful
home in one of the finest parts of the city.</p>

The two doctors in question are sons of this noble
author, Ivar being born in Bergen, Norway, March 1, 1865,
and Eiliv in Sel, Gudbrandsdalen, May 25, 1870. Both received
their early education by private tuition, and in 1882
emigrated with their parents to America, settling in Minneapolis.
They took advantage of the splendid school facilities
offered by that city as preparation for the state university of
Minnesota, where they graduated, 1892, with the degree of
Doctor of Medicine, M. D. Their collegiate records bespeak
scholarly distinction which have been made more emphatic
by subsequent years. Immediately after graduation, Dr. Ivar
Janson was appointed assistant professor in the medical
department at his alma mater, but resigned the chair to take
a move westward, arriving in Seattle, 1895, where he enjoys
an enviable practice, being recognized as a leading surgeon
on the Pacific. His brother, Dr. Eiliv Janson, steered his
fortune to Astoria, Oregon, in the fall following his graduation,
and soon rose to be one of the most beloved physicians
in the city. His ability invited the attention of the public,
and his practice grew immensely, being the largest in that
part of the state. The last year he has spent studying
at the universities of Europe, in Berlin, Dresden, Munich,
Copenhagen and Paris, and will join his brother in Seattle
next June. The two doctors have evinced the genius of their
father, but in a different direction, the sire a poet, the sons
surgeons and physicians. The former has climbed the ladder
of fame, the latter are climbing it. They are both married
to ladies of rare abilities and accomplishments. Mrs. Ivar
Janson is one of Seattle's most gifted vocalists. "Think for
yourself" is a soul-inspiring motto, and is applicable to the
Janson family. In spite of angry opposition and glittering
pelf the rich mind of Kristofer Janson has scattered sunbeams
of truth and thought. He has sought to lift his
countrymen upon the plane of reason and brotherly love. The
sons have imbred their father's soul of thought and sympathy,
which the public echo in more eloquent words than
my pen.</p>

C. N. Sandahl.&mdash;Washington is dependent on the science
of horticulture, fruit is her future. Any man willing to bend
his heart to the soil is a valuable exponent in the upbuilding
of the country. Few men have done more in this line than
the well-known floriculturist and nurseryman, C. N. Sandahl,
of 1123, Second Avenue, Seattle. He was born in Horsens,
Denmark, 1857; acquired his education in the public
schools of his fatherland, and in the smiling book of nature,
where real knowledge teems to an intelligent eye. In 1880
he emigrated to America, spent ten years in Ohio and Minnesota,
pursuing his chosen vocation, then journeyed to Washington
and located in Seattle. After a careful scrutiny of the
country he engaged in floriculture and nursery, which occupation
he is following with notable ability. Mr. Sandahl is a
man of business capacity as well as of scientific propensity,
and honest and honorable.</p>

Samuel S. Langland.&mdash;Quiet of disposition but deep in
thought, modest in demeanor but aggressive in argument.
The above words unfold Mr. Langland's characteristic, an able
lawyer of Seattle. He was born near Stavanger, Norway,
August 13, 1856, and emigrated with his parents to Minnesota
in the spring of 1867. His early boyhood experienced
the various hardships and vicissitudes incident to pioneer life.
At the age of fifteen he launched out for himself, choosing as
a means of support the apprenticeship of a tailor in Mancato,
in which capacity he labored a year and a half. From whence
he went to St. Paul, a stranger in an unwont sphere. English
defied his tongue, but soon melted to his grasping intellect.
He worked at his trade about two years, but to ascend to a
higher stage of culture, he converted his energy to loftier
aims, worked for his board and attended private school,
paying for his tuition by doing janitor work, sweeping and
keeping the schoolhouse in order. After two years of assiduous
study in this institution, he entered the classical course
of four years in the St. Paul High School which he completed
in three. In the fall of 1881 he was matriculated in the same
course at the state university, graduating with honor in June,
1885. At the commencement exercises he distinguished himself
by delivering the most thoughtful and eloquent oration
of the class, his subject being "Is Man Advancing?" for
which he received compliments from the faculty and leading
men of the state present on that occasion. His struggles at
the university with poverty symbolize an indomitable will.
He toiled evenings and Saturdays sawing wood and doing
other manual labor, his vacations were spent canvassing, or
in the harvest field. After darkness comes sunshine, and the
year following his graduation he was appointed professor of
English Literature in the Augsburg Seminary. In 1887 he
studied law in St. Paul, was admitted to bar, and practiced
for some time at Moorhead, Minnesota, where he made rapid
progress, being nominated prosecuting attorney on the democratic
ticket, but as that party was in the minority he went
to defeat with the rest of the candidates. At Moorhead he
was married to an estimable lady, Miss Esther Annette
Hutchison, and in December of 1890 moved to Puget Sound
as an alternative to regain health and vigor. Since 1891 he
has been practicing law in Seattle with growing promise, his
specialty being real estate litigation.</p>

A. Lundberg.&mdash;The person of this sketch, the educated
artificial limb manufacturer, A. Lundberg, was born in Kalstad,
Sweden, 1847, where he received a good schooling and
learned his benefactory profession. At the age of twenty-one
he set sail for America, locating in Minneapolis, where he
stayed until 1888, working at his trade. From whence he
moved to Spokane, Washington, residing in that city eight
years. Seattle had attracted notice as an appropriate seat for
a man of science and mechanical ingenuity, and thither he
migrated in 1896, establishing his headquarters in Sullivan
Building, First Avenue. Mr. Lundberg is the only artificial
limb manufacturer in the state of Washington; he was educated
for this work in early youth and has followed it
uninterruptedly. In many instances he has wrought out
wondrous results, cured cases that defied medical science. He
was married in Minneapolis, January 24, 1877, to a pleasant
lady, Miss Anna Dahlgren. They have three children,
Evalin, Denalda and Marie.</p>

C. G. W. Anderson.&mdash;Men are destined for divers avenues,
but a thoughtful man will follow the course of his
inclination in the climax upward, and success will smile as
he proceeds. Mr. C. G. W. Anderson seems to have incorporated
this maxim. He was born in Sweden, September 24,
1856, where he enjoyed the benefit of a good schooling and a
healthy course in the curriculum of experience. At the age
of twenty-six he left his native soil for the New World, arriving
in the United States, April 24, 1880. After ten years of
various employment in the eastern states he came to Seattle,
engaging in hotel business on the corner of Terrace and Fifth
Avenue, where the Anderson looms in emphasis of the proprietor's
energy. Mr. Anderson is a man of a genial disposition,
social and affable and in all respects an honored citizen.</p>

<p>Oscar Anderson.&mdash;A man of honor and integrity is a
worthy adjunct to any community. Oscar Anderson belongs
to this type which his career bespeaks. He was born in
Karlskrona, Sweden, January 13, 1859, where he received a
thorough education in the public schools. From boyhood he
showed talents attributive only to the soul of the genius. In
1872 he entered the hardware business, but abandoned it after
two years of experience to pursue the vocation of his forte&mdash;jewelry
and mechanism. In 1879 he engaged in business for
himself which he continued successfully until 1893. During
all these years he was employed by the Swedish navy mending
and adjusting the chronometers of the men-of-war. In
1891 the Russian government engaged his ingenuity, and on
one occasion he worked three days and three nights repairing
the chronometers of the navy for which he received a remuneration
of 297 crowns. In 1892 he spent considerable time
traveling in Denmark, partly for pleasure and partly for
studying the conditions of the country, Copenhagen being
the center of interest where he enjoyed himself for a few
months. The following year he sold out his business in
Sweden and emigrated for America, locating in Seattle, a
stranger in a strange country, but ere long his native "pluck"
was manifested, and a fine establishment at 406 Pike street
emphasizes his ingenuity and business ability.</p>

P. A. Hallberg.&mdash;Experience is the best teacher, a college
course of mere theories gives little knowledge of the world.
A course in fighting the billows of the deep, or wrestling with
the stumps of the forest, is of more practical worth than a head
crammed with deceased tongues, or theoretical airships. P.
A. Hallberg corroborates my view with his personal experience.
He was born in Skone, Sweden, 1867, and in his early
teens sought the waves. He visited China and other oriental
climes, faced the angry surges of Cape Horn, and dashed
ashore at San Pedro, California, from whence he sailed northward,
navigated for some time as mate on Puget Sound, also
served in the government marine. After years of sea-faring
life he turned his attention to terra firma, located in Seattle
and commenced new pursuits. He worked for three years in
the Union Bakery, then spent some time in a meat market,
and in 1894 bought the Union Bakery, and four years later
removed to Second Avenue, between Pike and Union, where
he is doing a large business. Mr. Hallberg is a man who has
won the respect of the people of Seattle by his integrity of
character and straight business method.</p>

John Nogleberg, a gifted artist, portrait, figure and landscape
painter, of Seattle, was born in Kongsberg, Norway,
February 21, 1861. He received a splendid education in his
native country in music, science and art, and in 1881 emigrated
to America, locating in Chicago, where he studied at
the Academy of Fine Art and at the Art Institute. After
nine years of close application to his chosen profession, he
moved to Seattle, where he has the largest establishment of
its kind west of Chicago, engaging constantly a number of
employees in the different departments.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1899 he moved into his elegant
building on Second Avenue, near Union Street, but from the
present indication of business his beautiful apartments will
soon prove too small. He is an athlete and an intense lover
of nature. The soul of grandeur and sublimity seems to be a
part of his being, which his masterpieces plainly reflect. He
is fond of outdoor sport, fishing and hunting give him pleasant
hours of recreation. He is an active member of the
Y. M. C. A., and a promoter of the Norwegian-Danish M. E.
church. In a word, Mr. Nogleberg is a true gentleman as
well as an artistic genius, being strictly temperance and of
noble aims and integrity.</p>

<p>Hans Hansen, manager of the Union Fish Company, and
a man of indomitable will power, was born in Norway, July
20, 1859, where he laid his foundation for an active career.
In 1881 he arrived in Minneapolis and six years later beheld
the city of Seattle. He settled on a homestead in the Quillayute
valley, but returned to the Queen City after a few years
of experience at farming. In 1896 he was elected to the
legislature, and became noted for his opposition to fish traps,
and his earnest support of Hon. George Turner for United States
senator. He has been a frequent contributor to the different
papers on political and reform topics. In religion he is a
Methodist.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS IN SEATTLE.<br />

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap"><b>Societies&mdash;Press&mdash;Prominent Citizens&mdash;Churches.</b></span></p>

<p>Scandinavians in Seattle have contributed largely to the
social feature of life. They have organized a number of
societies, some flourished immensely for some time, then died
a natural death, others have continued to prosper through
sun and storm. The Normanna Literary and Social Club
was among the first Norwegian societies, but alas! only a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
days of sunshine then clouds and dispersion. The Baltic
Lodge, I. O. G. T., was placed on record February 10, 1888,
and has since its birth drank vigor from the fountain of
wholesome reform. In a word, it is the healthiest Scandinavian
society in the city of Seattle, and some of the members
merit gratitude for their indefatigable work. G. Nygard,
Gust. Thompson, Ole Finnoy, Martin Erickson, Ole Larsen,
James Eggan, Anton Peters, B. H. Miller, Peter Peterson,
W. T. Hillestad, A. Zaar, and Belle and Lena Egge, Christina
Newgard, Augusta and Lottie Stromberg, Mrs. Emma Eggan,
Ida Peters and Matilda Iverson have sacrificed both time and
energy for the advancement of the temperance cause.</p>

<p>A Swedish society, baptized Svea, the 31st of May, 1889,
had but a few struggles with the chilly world. The following
year it withered into oblivion unsung. Nordmændenes Sangforening
(Norwegian Singing Society) was organized in
November, the same year, but soon gave signs of ephemeral
existence. The Sagatun was born the year after, lingered on
a narrow path for awhile, finally fell into an innocent grave.</p>

<p>The Swedish Club, organized in 1892, is a healthy and
vigorous society. From its embryo to the present time it has
had a smooth run of sunshine and prosperity. It takes unity
of hearts and energy to steer a social fleet through all sorts
of weather from the tiny stream of embarkation into the calm
sea of triumph. The Swedish Club has accomplished this.
The object of the organization is exclusively fraternal, to
unite the Swedish elements in the city by friendly ties, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
to extend a warm hand to those coming within its reach from
other cities or climes. The first officers were: H. E. Humer,
Prest., Rudolph Alm, V. Prest., David Petree, R. Sec., G.
Edinholm, F. Sec., Andrew Chilberg, Treasurer, A. T. Lundberg,
Librarian, Hugo Hettengren, M. C. At its rift of morn
only thirty-two names smiled on the recording scroll, while
now two hundred members in good standing bespeak its
strength, with the following incumbent officers: J. M. Johnson,
Prest., N. J. Nyquist, V. Prest., A. Zaar, R. Sec., H. J.
Norden, F. Sec., N. B. Nelson, Treasurer, A. T. Lundberg,
Librarian, J. Nyman, M. C., and P. J. Melin, Otto Roseleaf
and D. Nordstrom, Trustees.</p>

<p>The Danish Brotherhood, a national league of high
standard, aiming to benefit and to educate, found admission to
Washington about eleven years ago. The Seattle Lodge 29,
was organized April 8, 1888, with eleven chartered members,
which now numbers one hundred and fifty. The Danish
Sisterhood, an auxiliary to the Danish Brotherhood, has taken
steps in the right direction, working to sweeten and strengthen
the ties of love and mutual amicability.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Workingmen's society sprang into existence
about eight years ago, and lived through many scenes of
joy and pathos, now flourishing, now trembling to its foundation.
Alas! detonating meteors exploded within its labyrinth
and gloomy melancholy spread her black veil, an
oratorical flower dropped here, and a declamatory bloom
there, at last the tree of support shivered in chilly desolation,
and withered into nothingness.</p>

The Norse Club, organized three years ago, has reveled
in healthy sunshine, and smiling tendrils have encircled its
prop. The 17th of May, 1899, bespeaks its culmination.
The celebration of Norwegian independence under its banner
was a marked event among the Scandinavians.</p>

<p>Thousands of people gathered at Madison Park, Seattle,
from all parts of the Sound, to participate in perpetuating the
memory of the Norse heroes. Honor is due to the following
gentlemen for launching and piloting this social ship into a
haven of safety: H. P. Rude, C. M. Thuland, Frank Oleson,
Christian Bolgen, A. J. Thuland, A. H. Soelberg, B. A.
Clausen, N. A. Christof, A. Scottness, Theodore Pederson
and Julius Sunde.</p>

<p>Fremad, the social wing of the Norwegian Lutheran
church, has lived through many upheavals, and yet looks
forward with unclouded eyes. The other Scandinavian
churches have their inviting adjuncts, but of more recent
date, which tender valuable aids to their respective mothers.</p>

<p>Scandinavians in Seattle have been fortunate in having
men and women gifted and willing to make the social feature
of life entertaining and successful. Of all the gaudy society
flowers, no one merits more applause than the genial photographer,
James Eggan. He was born in Osterdalen, Norway,
1872, came to America in 1880, locating in the city of Minneapolis.
From boyhood he evinced unusual talent as a comedian
and as an artist. He could have gathered jewels on the
stage as well as in the photographic studio. In 1889, he set
out for the Pacific, and after taking a survey of the picturesque
Puget Sound, selected Seattle as his future abode. Though
only a youth of seventeen, yet he soon invited the attention of
the public in both the social and the artistic world. Not only is
Mr. Eggan possessed of natural endowments as a photographer
and as a reciter, but is a true type of integrity and honesty.</p>

Very few cities of three decades in the United States can
boast of more short-lived Scandinavian newspapers than
Seattle. The Scandinavian Publishing Company was the
first on record, and issued two Scandinavian weeklies, viz.,
Vestra Posten and Washington Posten, which yet live and
thrive. This company dissolved, and from its dissolution
sprang two others; The Swedish Publishing Company, issuing
Vestra Posten and a Norwegian concern of similar nature,
publishing Washington Posten.</p>

<p>Vestra Posten was founded by N. P. Lind and T. Sandegren,
and Washington Posten by Frank Oleson, assisted by
Julius Sunde. The former is at present in the hands of N.
G. Lind, J. W. Martin and A. Olson, who have raised the
paper to a high standard. The latter is owned and edited by
A. J. Thuland. C. M. Thuland, now lawyer, also gave heed
to journalism. He turned out Seattle Tidende and The
North, but both fell into an early tomb.</p>

<p>Julius and Engward Sunde organized and published
Fram, which blossomed and bore fruit, but one sad day it was
stretched on a lazy bier and wheeled to the grave. Folketidende
popped into existence about four years ago but through
some intrigue it died and was buried minus tears and ceremony.
Folkets Blad was the next of the ephemeral journals;
it was born in 1899, lingered through a few sunny months, then
swallowed, without pity, by Tacoma Tidende.</p>

Anent men of literary ability among the Scandinavians,
George Bech, without doubt, stands in the first rank. He is
a well-known author, musician and business man of Seattle,
born in Roeskilde, Denmark, April 4, 1846. After finishing
his education in the State School, 1865, he was awarded
the degree of A. M., and the following year took examen
philosophicus, Ph. M., at the University of Copenhagen;
studied mathematics for some time, then went into business,
trading in Norway, Sweden and Germany, but always assiduously
at work during leisure writing poems and novels for the
different journals of Denmark and Norway. In the latter country
he made acquaintance with Olaf Lofhus, editor of "Bergens
Tidende," to whose paper he frequently contributed, and
Johan Sverdrup, then president of the National Storthing, in
whose house he was a welcome guest. In 1887 he left Copenhagen,
arriving in Seattle, August 22, where he found a rich
field for his literary talent, for some time contributing to local
and other papers, then editor of Folkedidende, and later
Folkets Blad. He has written an exquisite dramatic work,
"Hæng Ham," and a song, "Old Glorious Glory," which he
has also put to music. It is Mr. Bech's ambition to have his
song adopted as a national hymn. He was married in May,
1880, and has one son, sixteen years old.</p>

<p>Graebert Anderson, an eloquent ex-minister of the M. E.
church, and a gifted writer, was born in Denmark, 1860.
After graduating from the public schools, he spent some time
in private study, with a view of entering some academy, but
instead of carrying out his plan, he left for America, when
about eighteen years old. Shortly after his arrival in the
New World, he commenced to prepare for the ministry of the
M. E. church at the university in Evanston, Illinois. Here
he spent five years, then migrated to the Pacific, where he has
been recognized as the most eloquent pulpit orator among the
Scandinavians on the coast, and has served as expounder of
the gospel in the largest Norwegian-Danish churches, namely
in Oakland and Eureka, California, and Tacoma and Seattle,
Washington. Two years ago he resigned from the ministry
to devote his time to journalism. In 1889 he was married to
Miss Lottie H. Christensen, a lady of fine education, a
teacher in the public schools of Racine, Wisconsin. They reside
in Seattle, where Mr. Anderson is interested in newspaper
business, being secretary of the Tacoma Tidende Publishing
Company, with office in Coleman building, First Avenue,
Seattle.</p>

Scandinavians have been liberal in their contributions to
religious worship. Eight Scandinavian churches in the city
of Seattle join to confirm this fact. The various denominations
are represented: Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, and
Mission Friends. There are one Swedish and two Norwegian-Danish
Lutheran churches, one Swedish and one Norwegian-Danish
Baptist churches, one Swedish and one Norwegian-Danish
Methodist churches, and one Swedish Mission church.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS IN BALLARD.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span></a></h2>

<p>Ballard merits the appellation, City of Smokestacks. No
small town west of the Rocky has more factories. Saw mills
and shingle mills are sending clouds of smoke into the air day
and night, and brigades of industrious men are busily engaged.
The city has been regarded by many as a suburb of
Seattle, but this is a misinterpretation. True, Ballard is near
Seattle, and is connected to it by a well-equipped street railway,
but has its own government.</p>

<p>The first Scandinavian who touched Salmon Bay, half a
mile below Ballard, was probably Peter Friberg. In 1875
Gustaf Anderson pitched his tent on a green spot near the
rippling water where he yet resides. He was born in Sweden,
crossed the Atlantic in 1864, and spent several years in Chicago
before coming to the Pacific. He is a man of intelligence and
holds a respectable rank among the people. Ole Schildstad,
a native of Norway, and highly respected, arrived simultaneously.</p>

<p>In those early days Ballard was undreamt. The smoke
which now curls above its bustle did not enter the calm of
the pioneers' hearts. They were contented with the peregrination
of daily necessity. Few Scandinavians then stalked
the dense forest which clad the turf where five thousand
people now dwell midst noise and progress, but today over
one thousand Vikings mingle in the various walks of life in
the town.</p>

John Johnson, the leading merchant and an intelligent
and honored citizen, is a native of Norway, being born
March 26, 1862, midway between Trondhjem and Levanger,
where he received his early education. At the age of ten he
emigrated to America, locating at Muskegon, Michigan,
attended the public schools three years, worked in a saw mill
four years, and clerked in a grocery store seven years. In
1886 he launched into business for himself which he is pursuing
with marked success. During the same year he
was married at Muskegon to a cultured young lady, Miss
Magna Nelson, whose parents hail from Tromso, Norway.
In 1893 Mr. Johnson moved to Ballard and immediately
embarked in grocery business. His large establishment and
business method plainly reflect his ability, and a multitudinous
circle of friends bespeaks his generosity and integrity of
character.</p>

<p>Frank Engquist, the well-known merchant tailor of
Ballard, was born in Sweden, 1861, received a fine education
in his native country, and in 1882 crossed the Atlantic for
the United States, settling at Moline, Illinois, where he
remained one and a half years. His next journey was to
Minneapolis, where he found employment in one of the largest
tailoring establishments in the city. In 1888 he migrated to
Seattle, Washington, and shortly after resumed his chosen
occupation. He was attracted by the fascinating aspect of
the Sound, and abandoned his business to try his hand at
agriculture in Rolling Bay. The gigantic trees and stubborn
stumps plucked the laurels of his fancy, and in 1896 started
business in Ballard, where he is permanently located. Mr.
Engquist is an expert workman, honest and intelligent, and
what is still loftier, a perfect gentleman.</p>

P. E. Paulson, a genial business man, was born in Norway,
1865. His father was a prominent educator, having
been engaged in school work about forty years. Mr. Paulson
enjoyed the benefit of an excellent education, and in 1882
sailed for America, locating in Rock county, Minnesota. After
two years of various occupation he arrived in Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, where he stayed two years. The Pacific exercised
a peculiar charm, and thither he emigrated, making
Skagit valley his first stopping place, and afterward located in
Ballard, where he now resides. Mr. Paulson is a leading
member of the Foresters of America and other organizations.
He is a man of a kind disposition, and universally respected.</p>

<p>I. C. Olson is a true type of honesty and individual character.
He was born in Norway, and for years resided in
Minneapolis. He came to the coast in 1893, settling in Ballard.
In 1898 he was elected to the legislature, where he
distinguished himself as a man of integrity and sound
judgment.</p>

<p>Thomas Anderson is a rising grocer, and a prominent
member of the Norwegian Baptist church, Revs. O. L. Hoien
and G. Berg are well liked and earnest ecclesiastics. Rev.
Martin Berg is editor of Kongeriget and an eloquent advocate
of Christian principles.</p>

<p>Scandinavians have made Tacoma their stronghold, about
10,000 dwell within the city boundary. Some rank among
the most thrifty and highly esteemed citizens. They also
bear the honor of being among the early pioneers who gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
light and courage to subsequent settlers. Mrs. Fredric Meyer,
a native of Norway, previously alluded to, was one of the first
white women to alight in Pierce county. Anton Malm, born
in Sweden, came to the coast in 1870, and mingled with the
first pioneers of Tacoma.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian business and professional men of Tacoma
merit kind consideration. They have risen to prominence and invited
the confidence and respect of all regardless of nationality.
A biographical history of the most prominent confronts
itself. They are exemplary men, and their rise to affluence
and influence in an honest, straightforward manner is worthy
of emulation.</p>

<p>Professor Olof Bull.&mdash;There are but few whose souls are
imbued with divine strains. Music like poetry is born with
a man. When Ole Bull was asked, "Who taught you to
play so sweetly?" he answered, "Norge's hoie Fjeld og dybe
Dale" (Norway's high mountains and deep dales). The name
of Olof Bull is synonymous to that of Ole Bull. The former
came from Sweden, the latter from Norway. Prof. Olof Bull
was born in Undersvik, Helsingland, Sweden, March 31,
1852. His parents were Olof and Katarina Bull, his father
is dead but his mother still lives. From early childhood he
evinced extraordinary talent for music which was cultivated
to a marked degree under A. Sorenson and other masters. In
1869 he sailed for America, arriving in St. Paul, where he
rapidly gained fame as a genius violinist. In 1876 he organized
the "Olof Bull Concert Company" which scattered divine
music the land over, and rose to enviable reputation. In 1881
he was appointed musical director of the Boston Opera, which
he resigned in a year to accept the professorship of violin in
the Chicago Musical College, where he remained until 1890,
when he journeyed to Tacoma to be installed as musical
director of Tacoma Theatre, which chair he is filling with
distinction. Professor Olof Bull is a genius as a violinist,
and greater still a man of character, kind and compassionate.</p>

O. B. Selvig.&mdash;The esteemed cashier of the Metropolitan
Bank of Tacoma, O. B. Selvig, was born near Drammen, Norway,
in 1851. He received a fine education, and at the age of
seventeen bid farewell to his native seat for America, arriving
in Kandiyohi county, Minnesota, with his parents. Young
Selvig, like others who come to a new country with scanty
means, had to do his own rustling. He worked in different
places at hard manual labor up to 1878, when he secured a position
in the postoffice at Willmar, and two years later received
the appointment of postmaster, and shortly after became head
agent for the American Express Company. He served faithfully
for seven years in this capacity, then resigned to accept
a more lucrative employment in the Kandiyohi County Bank.
In the fall of 1888 he migrated to Tacoma, Washington, and
after cultivating acquaintance with influential men in the city,
he was tendered a position in the Metropolitan Bank, and soon
rose to cashier. Mr. Selvig is not only a man of business, but
of honor as well; one beloved and respected by all.</p>

H. E. Knatvold.&mdash;In the fall of 1892, the Scandinavian American
Bank of Tacoma was organized, with a capital stock
of $100,000, raised partly in Tacoma and partly in the east.
H. E. Knatvold, well known in business circles, was elected
cashier and general manager of the institution. He was born
in Drammen, Norway, September 3, 1848, where he obtained
his early education. At the age of fourteen he sailed with his
parents for the United States, settling in Freelom county,
Minnesota. He engaged in farm work, and spent his leisure
studying, thus acquiring a fair knowledge of English. At the
age of twenty-one he removed to Albert Lea, where he secured
a clerkship in a store. To prepare himself to cope more
efficiently with the surges of the world, he relinquished his
position to take a course in Western College, Iowa, and shortly
after embarked in hardware business in Albert Lea. In 1884
he crossed the Rocky for the Pacific, locating in Tacoma. He
engaged in farming and real estate which he followed successfully
until 1892, when he was ushered into the chair of cashier
in the Scandinavian American Bank, which position he has
filled with credit ever since. Mr. Knatvold is a man of honor
and energy.</p>

Dr. C. Quevli.&mdash;It is a conceded fact that C. Quevli, of
Tacoma, is one of the most highly learned doctors on the Pacific.
He was born in Blakjer, Norway, June 24, 1864. When
six years old he left his fatherland with his parents for
America, locating in Jackson county, Minnesota, where he received
the education that the common schools could afford, then
took a course at St. Olof's College, Northfield, afterward entered
the State University of Minnesota, where he graduated
with the degree of M.D. He launched into a typo for successful practice
at Lamberton, Minnesota, but his soul was thirsting for
more knowledge, and to satisfy this he sailed for Christiania,
Norway, where he took a post-graduate course. On returning
to the United States he selected Tacoma for his future abode.
Here he practiced three years, then returned to Europe to
continue his studies at the University of Berlin, from whence
he crossed the channel to England, and took a post-graduate
course in Kings College and Hospital of London. Afterward
he traveled in France and other European countries before
voyaging to America. Dr. C. Quevli is a physician of enviable
reputation, but that is not all; he is a gentleman beloved and
honored.</p>

Dr. J. L. Rynning.&mdash;The well-known doctor and professor
of physiology in the Pacific Lutheran University, J. L.
Rynning (formerly Dr. J. L. Jensen), of Tacoma, has gained
friends and eminence in his chosen profession. He was born
in Iowa, 1858, of Norwegian parents, who removed to the
frontier of Minnesota while he was an infant of one year.
Young Rynning did not enjoy the opportunities that most
boys have. The schoolhouse was unknown to him until ten
years of age. When time offered a rural schooling he took
advantage of it as preparation for the public school of Rushford,
later studied at the academy of Madison, Wisconsin, and
Luther College, Decorah, Iowa. He had a whim for the
West, and migrated to Montana where he engaged in school
work. Mines, too, invited his notice, and during his vacation
of 1889 held the superintendency of a silver mine in Montana.
Mining, however, was abandoned for a more professional
career, and in 1892 graduated from Rush Medical
College in Chicago with the degree of Medicinæ Doctor, M.
D. Immediately after graduation he located at Butte, Montana,
where he practiced for some time. In 1893 he was
married in Minnesota to Miss Marie Ellertson, a lady of fine
training, and took a wedding trip to the Pacific. He foresaw
the great future of the country, and removed to Stanwood,
Washington, to follow his profession. When the Lutheran
University was established at Parkland, he removed to Tacoma
to tender his aid to the institution. In this city he is permanently
located, encircled with a multitude of friends. Dr.
Rynning is a man of heart as well as ability, honest, kind
and sympathetic.</p>

Eric Edw. Rosling.&mdash;Tacoma has reason to feel proud of
the personage of my pen, Eric Edw. Rosling, one of the ablest
lawyers on the coast. He was born in Stockholm, Sweden,
March 3, 1865, and came to Boston with his parents while a
young boy. From infancy he displayed extraordinary talents,
which subsequent years have made more realistic. After
acquiring a liberal education he entered the Boston University
Law School, where he graduated with honors, completing a
three years course in two. In 1890 Mr. Rosling arrived
in Tacoma and at once manifested the same tireless energy
which characterized his success at college. As a lawyer he
has but few equals, his logical and oratorical endowments
make him especially fit for the eminent profession he is pursuing.
He is a man of literary taste and studious habit
which his large law and private libraries join to emphasize.
In 1897 he was appointed by the Supreme Court of Washington
as chairman of the committee to examine applicants
for admission to the bar. In politics he is a republican, but
has refused to accept any political office save the office of
city prosecuting attorney during Huson's administration.
Twice he has been elected to the board of education and has
filled with distinction its presidential chair. His deep interest
in educational and church work has made him a valuable
factor throughout the Pacific. His oration at the Willamette
Chautauqua Assembly, Oregon City, in July, 1898, and his
address at the National Educational Association, Los Angeles,
1899, placed him before the nation as an eloquent speaker and
a finished scholar. He was married at Tacoma, December 12,
1890, to Miss Minnie Belle Lincoln, an accomplished lady of
Boston. They have three children and a beautiful home in
the finest part of the city.</p>

J. M. Arntson.&mdash;Self-made men, as a rule, become the
leaders in a free country where ability shines with unclouded
luster. The individual in question, J. M. Arntson, a rising
lawyer of Tacoma, is a representative of this class. He was
born on a farm in Waukesha county, Wisconsin, 1858, where
his parents, Johannes and Mekaline, settled in 1844, they being
among the first Norwegian emigrants to that part of the state.
When eight years of age his parents removed to the central
part of Minnesota where they engaged in general merchandise
business. Here young Arntson was reared and trained
for a mercantile career, his education was obtained in the
public schools and by private instruction. He was married
at Willmar, Minnesota, 1882, to Miss Annie M. Olson, a lady
of heart and character, and the next year joined the army of
homeseekers, attracted to the shores of Puget Sound, and
settled in Tacoma, Washington. Since coming to this city
he has been engaged in various pursuits, first grocery
then real estate. From youth he had possessed an inclination
for law, and to yield to his forte, he closed out his
business, and devoted his whole time to legal acquirements.
In 1894 he was admitted to bar, and immediately embarked
in practice which has constantly grown more promising. In
1898 he received the appointment as clerk of police court, and
in connection with the duties of his office continues a lucrative
practice. Though Mr. Arntson was born and raised in
America, yet he has been a warm friend of the Norwegians,
always ready to extend a helping hand when needed. He is
delighted with Norwegian literature, being conversant with
social and political problems.</p>

Gustaf Lindberg, a representative business man of Tacoma,
was born in Vermland, Sweden, November 22, 1865,
received a careful education, and at the age of fourteen
embarked in business as clerk in his native place. In 1881 he
chose the national capital of Sweden for his abode, where he
obtained a clerkship with the firm of C. A. Schweder. Being
of studious nature and industrious habit, he worked faithfully
during day, and attended school during evening, thus
acquiring a store of useful learning and applicable experience.
In 1889 he left the land of his birth for America,
locating in Tacoma, where he found employment with the grocery
firm of Forbes &amp; Wose. After two years of service with this
company, he joined his brother John in the grocery business,
now a leading establishment on the corner of Eleventh and
G Streets. Mr. Lindberg is a prominent factor in the Swedish-Lutheran
church and a worthy member of the Tacoma Chamber
of Commerce, and in all respects an honored citizen and
a true gentleman.</p>

S. Samson.&mdash;For being a young man few have displayed
steadier habits and more business capacity than the congenial
proprietor of the People's Hotel and Restaurant, 913 Pacific
Avenue, Tacoma. He was born in Ostra Torsa, Kronoberg,
Sweden, November 29, 1869, where he enjoyed the training
of splendid school facilities. In 1888 he crossed the stormy
Atlantic, and selected Tacoma for his permanent location.
During his early time in the New World he shared the vicissitudes
of circumstances, ever converting his leisure to useful
acquirements. The language was foreign to him, but being
of docile aptitude this obstacle did not long impede his progress,
soon he could handle the English tongue with ease and
fluency. Business seemed to be his forte, which he embarked
in some years ago and has followed with marked success.
He is a member of the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce and
owns considerable real estate in the city. Mr. Samson has
always been awake to the interest of the Pacific, and especially
his own town. He is a worthy citizen and enjoys the respect
of the people.</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap"><b>Societies&mdash;Press&mdash;Prominent Citizens&mdash;Churches</b></span></p>

<p>A number of Scandinavian societies have sprung into
existence in Tacoma the last two decades. The Valhalla, a
Swedish fraternal and beneficial organization, was the first
that blossomed into prosperity. It was organized December
15, 1884, with G. F. Linquist, president, H. Nyman, vice-president,
H. Ohlin, secretary, W. P. Sundberg, treasurer, R.
Bomen, financial secretary, Charles Berg, master of ceremony.
Only few signed the constitution at its early launching, but
has gradually increased in membership to 125 in good standing.
A praise-worthy band, known as the "Swedish Valhalla
Military Band," was founded by the society to grace its work
with sweet music.</p>

<p>The Norwegians organized a lodge of similar nature as
the Valhalla, baptized, The Ancient Order of Vikings, which,
too, embarked with a handful of supporters, but through perseverance
and wise management bloomed into one of the best
Norwegian societies in the state. The aim of this compact is
broad and laudable, being like that of the I. O. O. F., or other
secret organizations of high standard. The Vikings was born
in 1892 with the following hard workers in the lead: John
Blaauw, Thomas Knudson, G. O. Sande, Ed. Haug and Sam
Haug.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The Danish Brotherhood was instituted in March, 1889,
with fifteen members, and has flourished these years remarkably.
At present it has sixty on the roll, with a flowery
adjunct, the Danish Sisterhood, which has tendered the
fraternal order kind assistance.</p>

<p>Haabet, a Norwegian literary society, has grown in vigor
and number, and is proving valuable to literary culture. The
incumbent officers are: Con. Bjorklund, Prest., Jacob Slippern,
V. Prest., H. Hansen, Sec., John Blaauw, Treasurer, G. O.
Sande, Librarian, Hans Tokelsen, Editor.</p>

<p>The Norden, I. O. G. T., founded in early days, wrought
out many disagreeable obstacles, and planted seeds of moral
purity, but the panic of recent years scattered the prop of support
to the four wings of the world, and the pretty flowers that
wont to grace the hall found pleasure in other spheres. Week
after week the lodge trembled on flirting arms, which little by
little gave heed to other diversions, and death on wooly wings
devoured the civilizing factor.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian Temperance Society lived through
many years of gnawing resistance. From it floated mighty
words of wholesome advice, but friends of the alcoholic hell,
robed with smiling garbs of infernal warp, plucked the sweet
blooms of future hope, and planted in their souls the stings of
ruin. As days wore away, the poisonous influence from the
saloon den bewitched the sprightly stripling and the hoary
hair, and the temperance workers, the noblest of heroes, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
too few to feed the fire of interest, and the organization withered
and died.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian press, of Tacoma, is growing into popularity.
The first Scandinavian newspaper on record in the
city was, "Tacoma Budstikken," a Norwegian-Danish weekly,
founded in December, 1899, by P. O. Bergan, but enjoyed only
a short period of sunshine. The Tacoma Tidende was launched
July 5, 1890, and ripened into a Norwegian-Danish state paper.
From infancy it was in the hands of Dirk Blaauw who bid fair
at journalism, but a year ago it was transferred to his brother
John who has steeped it with journalistic fire, comparing in
merit with the big eastern weeklies. It takes a man of a congenial
nature, ability and "push" to make journalism a success,
and these qualities manifest themselves every day in the
editor of Tacoma Tidende.</p>

<p>John Blaauw was born in Bergen, Norway, 1868, but
when an infant of two years he went with his parents to
Christiania, where he resided till he reached the age of seventeen,
save two and a half years he spent in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In 1887 he emigrated to America, making Seattle his
destination. Right after the great fire he embarked in Scandinavian
journalism, and has practically followed it ever
since.</p>

resources on the Pacific coast than Editor John Blaauw. He
has traveled in every county from British Columbia to the
Golden State. He has made Tacoma Tidende an honor to
the coast and a valuable source of information to thousands of
people throughout the United States. He is of a genial disposition,
kind and serviceable. Though always busy, yet glad
to receive visitors, and willing to impart all possible knowledge.
Much of his time is consumed in replying to letters concerning
the Pacific country.</p>

<p>Tacoma Tribunen, a Swedish weekly of considerable merit,
was brought to light in April, 1890, by the Swedish Publishing
Company. T. Sandegren was installed as editor, and has
ever since filled the chair with credit.</p>

<p>T. Sandegren was born near Halmstad, Sweden, in 1858,
where he enjoyed the benefit of a good common school education.
At the age of twenty he graduated from Lund College,
and three years later took the degree of A. B. at the University
of Lund. Journalism was his forte which he embarked
immediately after graduation. In 1883 he crossed the Atlantic
for the United States, locating in Minnesota, where he
obtained a position as teacher in the Military School at Fort
Snelling. In 1889 he migrated to Seattle, and in company
with N. P. Lind organized Vestra Posten. The following year
he was appointed editor of Tacoma Tribunen, and three years
later assumed the ownership of the paper, which he is conducting
with marked ability.</p>

<p>A word concerning Scandinavian churches may not be
out of place at this point. In spite of a new country and
adverse circumstances, nine of them pierce the air of the
City of Destiny. There are three Lutheran churches,
two Norwegian-Danish, and one Swedish; two Methodist
churches, one Norwegian-Danish, and one Swedish; two Baptist
churches, one Scandinavian and one Swedish; a Swedish
Mission church, and a Scandinavian Free church.</p>

greatest of stir and excitement, and has ever since enjoyed the
presence of healthy sunbeams and steady prosperity. Everett
is the county seat of Snohomish county, spread over a pleasant
stretch of land between Snohomish river and a beautiful
bay of the Sound, affording an excellent fresh-water
harbor and an equally laudable salt-water haven.</p>

<p>The city has a population of about eight thousand, many
of whom are Scandinavians. John Brue was among the early
pioneers, and one of the founders of the Norwegian Lutheran
church located at that place. For years he was engaged in
business in Everett, but disposed of his interests to take
possession of a nice farm near Stanwood.</p>

T. T. Enger, a bright business man, merchant tailor,
was also one of the first to establish himself in the embryo
city. He was born in Hoff, Solor, Norway, 1864, but moved
with his parents to Aasnes when one and a half years of age,
where he received his early education, graduating from the public
schools at fifteen. His father, also, T. T. Enger, was a prominent
citizen and manager of H. Schulze's estate, the largest
in that part of Norway. Young Enger left his native seat for
Christiania to learn the tailoring trade, and in 1882 emigrated
to America, arriving at Madison, Wisconsin, September 22,
where he remained two years working at his trade. His next
move was to Minneapolis, and in 1891 migrated to the Pacific,
settling in Seattle, Washington. Shortly after his arrival he
was married to Miss Maria Olson, a worthy lady of Norse
ancestry. The transient fame of Anacortes startled the
country, and thither Mr. Enger went to engage in business,
but in January, 1892, sold out and removed to Everett, where
he is conducting a fine tailoring establishment. Mr. Enger
is a man of energy and "push," reliable and respected. He
is a prominent member of the Knights of Pythias, and holds
notable standing in the republican party.</p>

<p>Few men have passed through the trials that L. P. Elvrum
has, the genial landlord of Everett. He was born in Stordalen,
near Trondjem, Norway, 1858, where he received a good education.
At the age of nineteen he went to sea, and was dashed
uninterruptedly on the pitiless waves for four years. Three
times he weathered the North Cape. In 1881 he sailed for
America, spent one year in Minnesota, then journeyed to the
Pacific, settling at Stanwood, Washington. He sought the
forest for employment, worked four years at logging, then
embarked in general merchandise in Silvana, and immediately
received the appointment of postmaster. In 1889 he was married
to Miss Martha Beck, an estimable lady of Cedarhome.
When Everett commenced to bespeak business prospects, Mr.
Elvrum sold out his interests at Silvana and went thither to
start a hotel. He is the proprietor of the "North Star," one
of the most respectable taverns in the city. Mr. Elvrum is a
man of business nature, social and congenial, honest and a
true gentleman. He has had many ups-and-downs, but his
motto has been, "Try and continue trying and you will succeed
at last." A motto that every man ought to drink into
his soul for ready application in the various turns of life.</p>

There are also other Scandinavians in Everett who shine
in business and social circles. A. O. Solberg is a leading
jeweler, and O. Alseth a genial clerk and a popular member of
the Lutheran church; Martin Dahl is a well-known merchant
tailor, and J. A. Johansen a progressive grocer.</p>

<p>Everett has within its limit two Scandinavian churches, a
Norwegian Lutheran, previously alluded to, and a Scandinavian
Methodist, which was built in 1893. Rev. P. M. Ellefsen,
a Methodist missionary, visited Everett, 1892, and the following
year organized a congregation of ten members which now
numbers thirty. Rev. O. Heggen was the first appointed
minister to occupy the pulpit, who was succeeded by the eloquent
Rev. O. O. Twede.</p>

<p>A Young Peoples' Society was organized some years ago
which has grown healthy and vigorous; at present it has a
membership of forty.</p>

<p>Among the leading members of the Methodist congregation
we find E. A. Olson, Swede, L. Carlsen, A. Thompsen,
H. Helgesen, and Mrs. H. Helgesen, Norwegians.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS AT STANWOOD.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span></a></h2>

<p>Stanwood is the largest Scandinavian community in the
State of Washington, situated in Snohomish county, on a
delta-like angle, where the Skagit and the Stillaguamish rivers
meet to mingle their blue volumes. A navigable tongue of
the Sound ripples up the flat, where daily steamers gracefully
ride for the proud city. To the east and west from this thriving
villa a panorama of inexhaustible fertility spreads out before
your eye, dotted with quaint dwellings, here and there
flecked with rich orchards, and slowly sweeps up forming what
is generally termed highland, where a Swedish colony smiles
with flowery gardens and beautiful farms.</p>

<p>Stanwood compares in magnitude and importance with
the eastern Scandinavian settlements, but differs vastly from
them in spirit. Here is more life, more freedom, and English
the prevailing language, especially among the younger folks.</p>

<p>In 1870, the time that Eller Graham, a native of Norway,
disembarked at the mouth of Skagit river, a white man was a
curiosity. Doubtless Graham was the first Scandinavian to
seek the wilderness for a nestling place, though it is probable
that Martin Toftezen, who landed on Whidbey Island twelve
years prior, had made a reconnoissance of both Skagit and
Stillaguamish rivers.</p>

Sivert Guligson Brekhus threw anchor where the Stillaguamish
disembogues its waters, 1873, but made his permanent
habitation ten miles up the river. Two years later O. B.
Iverson made his appearance as government surveyor, and almost
simultaneously N. P. Leque, Nils Eide and A. Danielson
landed in fair-sized canoes. These pioneers had the sagacity
and foresight to unfold the future, and bought three hundred
acres of land together. The first named, O. B. Iverson, was
elected to represent Snohomish county in the territorial legislature,
where his keen intellect made palpable impressions.
He now resides in Olympia, and is an active member of the
government surveying staff.</p>

<p>N. P. Leque is a highly respected citizen, a gentleman in
the true sense of the word. He was born in Kinservik, Hardanger,
Norway, May 8, 1848, but moved with his parents to
Ulvik when two years old. After receiving a good common
school education, he entered the normal school in Voss, where
he graduated with honor in 1865. The following year he engaged
in teaching, but abandoned it after two years of successful
experience. The 11th of April, 1868, he was married to
Miss Maria Lindebrekke, a lady of fine intellect and noble
aims, and the same year sailed for America, settling at Vermillion,
Clay county, South Dakota, where he embarked in
farming. The smiling Pacific created a desire for another
journey, and July 31, 1875, he paraded the streets of Tacoma,
with his family. He made a perambulation of the country,
and in 1876 located on a beautiful island, which bears his
name.</p>

<p>In 1886 he was elected county commissioner, served with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
distinction for two years, and declined renomination. He has
been and is a valuable member of the Lutheran church of
Stanwood, and has always sought to enhance the best interests
of the community, morally and otherwise. For some time he
has been president of the Stanwood Co-operative Creamery.</p>

<p>Peter Leque, a close relative of N. P. Leque, is doubtless
one of the most popular Scandinavians on the Pacific coast.
He was born in Norway, but came to America in his early
years, and received a fine education in the common
schools and at the State University of Washington. Ever
since 1875 he has resided on Leque Island, hard by Stanwood.
He is a man of a grasping mind and elevated thoughts, a hard
worker and a faithful representative of the common people.
A man that the public has picked out to fill responsible positions
on the merit of honesty and ability. In 1888 he was
elected county surveyor, in 1892 county assessor, and in 1894
county auditor.</p>

<p>O. K. Melby, proprietor of Melby Hotel, and a man of
intelligence and fine training, has shared the struggles of
pioneer life. He was born in Norway, came to the coast 1875,
made a visit to Stanwood, and the following year located in
the embryo villa permanently, being the first Scandinavian to
engage in hotel business in this part of the state.</p>

<p>John Brygger, A. J. Brue, Peter Gunderson, Christian
Joergensen, Martin Larson, Iver Egge, C. Toftezen, L. T.
Land, O. J. Finley, Ole Ryan, Thomas Brue and John Brue
are among the early settlers and the most prominent citizens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
They are all independent farmers and potent factors in the
upbuilding of the country.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Lutheran church of Stanwood is the
oldest of the Lutheran churches on Puget Sound. It was
organized twenty-three years ago by Rev. L. Carlson, and has
enjoyed the services of Revs. Emil Christensen, P. Isberg
and C. Joergensen. At present it is in charge of Rev. L. C.
Foss who has done much for Christianity and the Lutheran
doctrine. He is a friend of the young people as well as of
the old, the guiding spirit of the Young People's Society and
a talented musician.</p>

The Norwegian Singing Society is the pride of the community,
and has scattered laurels of accomplishment along
the Sound. On many occasions it has been called to Seattle
and other places to cheer and entertain the people with sweet
melodies.</p>

<p>The progress and success of the Scandinavian business
men of Stanwood are well known. S. A. Thompson's establishment
affords credit to the town, and Knud Knudson's
drug and jewelry store compares nicely with similar concerns
in the larger cities. B. Willard, the popular dairyman, hails
from Denmark. His energy and keen intellect have always
been at willing option for the good of his adopted country. A.
Tackstrom, the genial postmaster, was born in Sweden, and
has been of practical usefulness to his city. Edward Foss
traces his birthplace to Norway, but has resided for years in
Stanwood. He is a mechanic by trade, and a gentleman in
demeanor. H. C. Anderson, the wealthy Klondiker, who resides
near the city, is a conspicuous factor, especially in agricultural
developments. The genial photographer, J. T.
Wagness, has gained a standing among the people as a man
of ingenuity in his chosen profession. Biographical sketches
of men who have worked themselves up in an honorable way
would doubtless be of interest to the readers. Such men as
S. A. Thompson, Knud Knudson, and others merit a place
among the most prominent Scandinavians on the Pacific coast.</p>

S. A. Thompson was born in Norway, 1864, where he
received a splendid school education. In 1880 he arrived in
America, locating at Story City, Iowa, remaining two years,
then chose Moorhead, Minnesota, for his habitation. After a
stay of four years in this city he migrated to Holdstead in the
same state where he spent two years. Up to this time Mr.
Thompson had been engaged in sundry occupations, clerking
and manual labor, always devoting his leisure to the acquirement
of an education. In 1888 he landed in Stanwood, and
immediately embarked in business. For some time he was
connected with shingle mills, entered Irvine's store, clerked
five years, and May 1, 1895, assumed possession of the whole
firm. Mr. Thompson is a man of genial nature, kind and
social, at the same time energetic, which his business career
plainly emphasizes.</p>

<p>Knud Knudson, the gifted jeweler and drug merchant,
was born in Modum, Norway, 1864. After learning the
watchmaking trade, he sailed for America, arriving in Valley
City, North Dakota, 1885, where he worked at his trade one
year. He was touched by reports from Caselton, packed
together his effects and moved thither, engaged in business
for two years, then took another trip, viz., to Chamberlain,
South Dakota, but one and a half years sufficed at this place.
Washington was now the absorbing question, and in 1890
located in Stanwood, and established the first jewelry store
in the city. In 1896 he launched into drug business in connection
with his already lucrative engagement. Mr. Knudson
is a leading business man, always busy and attentive, reliable
and respected.</p>

Sound&mdash;honored and intelligent&mdash;wealthy and conscientious.
He came to America in 1866, spent eleven years in Minnesota,
twelve years in North Dakota, then journeyed to Stanwood,
Washington. He owns a magnificent farm, running

with Rev. C. Joergensen, who deserves the applause
of the whole community for his indefatigable energy. Mr.
Joergensen is an ex-minister of the Lutheran faith, armed

The Stanwood Co-operative Creamery has carried away
many honors since 1895, the date of its commencement. It
took the first prize, 1896, at the County Fair of Pierce county,
held in Tacoma, also the first prize in Ellensburg, 1898, at
the State Dairy Association. The output of butter has gradually
increased, at present averaging about eighteen thousand
pounds per month.</p>

<p>D. G. Bennie, Jr., manager of the Stanwood Co-operative
Creamery, has engraved his good will on the hearts of the
community. His business methods are commendable, emphatic
of honesty and ability. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts,
December 14, 1866, came to the Pacific coast, 1885,
embarked in logging and farming, and in the spring of 1898
he was elected to his present position, which he has filled with
entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>M. O. Coltom, superintendent of the butter-making department,
is a worthy gentleman, who has filled his calling with
credit to himself and the association. He was born in Toten,
Norway, forty-three years ago, came to America, 1866, and to
the coast, 1887. He has been connected with the creamery
since its infancy, and has always been vigilant to the best
interests of the enterprise. John Lund, also a native of Norway,
has been a faithful assistant to Mr. Coltom, for years he
has served in his present capacity with honor.</p>

Stanwood is surrounded by thrifty Scandinavian farmers,
the earliest have already been mentioned. Some of the more
recent who have added laurels to agriculture are: Ole Naas,
Peter Peterson, T. K. Logan, O. Alseth, Anton F. Anderson,
Otto Coltom, Oluf, John and Gunder Otterson, Engbret
Olson, Peter Holte, N. B. Thomle, Louis Christiansen and
others.</p>

<p>Stanwood, as stated before, is largely populated with
Scandinavians; in addition to the number previously noted
we find many good citizens, namely: Herman Hafstad, connected
with the Stanwood Hardware Company, Carl Ryan,
clerk in Eureka Grocery, Fred Ryan, clerk in Thompson's
store. Peter O. Wold and Ivar Opdal are representative Norwegians,
well liked and respected. Bert Gunderson is an
intelligent young man; the members of the Norwegian Singing
Society rank among the best of young people, Saul Olson,
Ole Mellum, Elias Brue, Sam Lovik, Halvor Anderson; John
Melkild, Peter Brandall and others bespeak Norse integrity.
A. B. Klaeboe, now a gold seeker in Alaska, was once a leading
business man of this city. Twelve years ago he established
the first drug store in Stanwood, which he managed
with notable success for a number of years. He was born in
Norway where he graduated from college with distinguished
scholarship.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS IN STILLAGUAMISH VALLEY.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span></a></h2>

<p>The Stillaguamish valley, spreading out for a considerable
distance on both sides of the wandering river, which
starts in the green-clad hills, looming up in the southeast,
and leaps gracefully downward to the city of Stanwood, where
it disembogues its waters, is a fertile plain, running through
the forest for twenty-five miles, adorned with royal farms and
three happy villas&mdash;Florence, Norman and Silvana. Thirty
years ago this noble stretch was the home of wild beasts, but
now settled by a jolly populace. Here the Scandinavians found
a field that hit their fancies&mdash;plenty of work and rich soil.</p>

<p>The first Scandinavian to brave this wilderness was Sivert
Guligson Brekhus, a native of Voss, Norway, who emigrated
to America, 1862, spent eleven years in the east combatting
for success in divers avenues, and in 1873 entered the mouth
of the Stillaguamish river. He proceeded up the stream which
was choked with angry snags and stubborn logs. No less than
four jams impeded his progress. Mr. Brekhus has been a
man of unusual strength, and possessed of a heart that knew
no fear. On one occasion, in early days, a red savage attacked
him in Stanwood. Mr. Brekhus was alone which gave his
heathen aggressor, surrounded by a bloodthirsty horde of his
race, lust for blood, and, like a devil in flames, seized a
manageable piece of timber and sought to convert the white
man to a heap of jelly. The brave Vossing approached him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and the following words burst from his lips, "Hvis du inhji
parsa dig ska eg slaa huvu ini majin paa dig." The red
skins understood the depth of his voice, and skulked away.</p>

<p>Ah! picture to yourself the hardship! All the provisions
had to be canoed from Seattle, and four boats were required
to reach Mr. Brekhus' ranch. Many struggles did this valorous
pioneer pass through. Once he carried a barrel of
herring on his shoulders over the four jams, and at another
time a big cook stove.</p>

<p>Iver Furness, father of John Furness, the Norman merchant,
has also partaken of the trials and difficulties common
to pioneer encounters. As early as 1879 he dates his first
peregrination on Stillaguamish river. Like other adventurers
he endured many days of hardship, anxiety and worry.
Supplementary to the toil for subsistence, the savages cast
chilly currents through his soul. The Sauk Indians, ravaging
in Skagit county, were dreaded like devils. One day
the report reached the home of Iver Furness, while relishing
a healthy dinner, that the Sauks were paddling up the river
for a bloody massacre. Mrs. Furness was thrown into a
trance of fright, rushed for the door with knife in hand to
take refuge in the woods. Johnny, her son, grabbed
the fire-lock to protect their home, but, lo! it was only an
Indian scare.</p>

Iver Johnson, the pioneer merchant of Silvana, and the
popular county commissioner, was born in Opdal, Norway,
1848. After graduating from the public schools, he took a
course in the higher branches of learning by private tuition,
and in 1869 sailed for the United States, selecting South
Dakota for his first abode in the New World. In 1875 he
took another step westward, locating at Port Gamble, Washington,
where he worked in saw mills for two years. Returning
to South Dakota, he was married to Martha Haugan, a
charming young lady, but to his sorrow she withered for the
grave after four years of matrimonial happiness. He
recrossed the Rocky Mountain the same year, settling in the
Stillaguamish valley, worked in logging camps and cleared
land for some time, then embarked in general merchandise at
Silvana, the first store in the Stillaguamish valley. He sold
out his interests at Silvana to accept a clerkship in D. O.
Pearson's store in Stanwood, which he abandoned after five
years of faithful service to assume the position as deputy
county auditor. In 1898 he was elected to the office of county
commissioner of Snohomish county in which capacity he is
now working with credit to himself and to his constituents.
He was married the second time, in 1887, to Miss Maria
Funk, an accomplished lady of Norse extraction.</p>

<p>Halvor Helvy, an intelligent farmer near Silvana, figures
among the first pioneers. He was born in Norway, and came
to Stillaguamish from South Dakota, 1878.</p>

E. A. Hevly, the popular merchant of Florence, and one of
the brightest business men on the Sound, was born in Opdal,
Norway, February 28, 1866, came to America, 1878, and the
same year landed on the Pacific coast. After receiving a common
school education, he took a course in the state University
of Washington. For years he was employed as clerk, but in
1891 became the sole owner of a large mercantile establishment,
which he is conducting with marked ability. Mr.
Hevly is a congenial man, honest, honorable and energetic.</p>

<p>John I. Hals, proprietor of Hals' shingle mill, located
across the river from Florence, is a true type of Norse manhood.
He was born in Norway, came to Stanwood, 1882,
worked four years in a saw mill at Utsalady, and in 1889
bought from Munson, Johnson and Company a shingle mill
standing one mile east of Stanwood, the first Scandinavian
shingle mill in Snohomish county. Cedar timber was getting
scarce and a change of location became advantageous. To
effect this he sold his mill, bought eighty acres of land further
up the river, and built a new mill, of which Mr. Hals is the
sole owner. The author does not believe in plowing up the
field of exaggeration, and so far as the personage in question
is concerned no occasion affords an opportunity. The men
working for Mr. Hals speak in more eloquent language than
my pen. In a word, Mr. Hals is a gentleman, kind, intelligent
and generous.</p>

Round Florence are also other Scandinavians who have
scattered light of melioration. Flowery meadows and royal
dwellings join to pronounce their industry and rank of
intelligence. Mr. Myro is an early pioneer and a thrifty Dane.
Taral Larsen is a prosperous farmer, a native of Norway, who
has shared the struggles of frontier life. Ed Hanson, also a
Norwegian by birth, has been a valuable factor in the community,
especially in the promotion of education. As we
proceed up the river we find an unbroken settlement of well-to-do
Scandinavians, who sought the wilderness to make
homes. Engebret and Sven Stenson, Sivert and Rasmus
Knutson and S. Erickson were among the first. L. O. Stubb,
a prominent farmer and a man of ability and influence, has
given valuable service to the community. He has been one
of the foremost men to look after the interest of education.
He was born in Norway, came to Dogfish Bay, Washington,
1880, and the same year settled near Norman.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS AT CEDARHOME.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span></a></h2>

<p>Three miles east of Stanwood smiles a beautiful villa,
which fifteen years ago received the baptism Cedarhome. It
seems as though Nature in her wisdom long, long ago took
special pains to prepare a plot for this smoothly sloping
panorama. If it had been whittled out to order for a quiet,
sober and intelligent people nothing more consistent could
have been expected.</p>

<p>In early days a dense forest clothed this spot, and savage
brutes ruled unrestrained. But some forty years ago the
irascible agent&mdash;fire&mdash;resolved to show his power, which he
did like an unchained demon. He sent his red flames from
tree to tree, consuming big and small, save some stubborn
giants, which remained black skeletons in melancholy loneliness.
Bears, cougars, wild-cats, and other inhabitants of the
forest picked up their feet and with lightning speed sought
the mountains for refuge.</p>

<p>The once rich sylva, where evergreen and foliage were
wont to join in sweet choruses, was now a charcoal desert with
a few angry monsters frowning in the air, squealing and
cracking to the breath of every breeze.</p>

<p>Years elapsed, the sun sent down his gentle beams, the
clouds unlocked their opulent stores, and the parched earth
drank her fill, and gave birth to shoots that blossomed into a
carpet of green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

Ah, all a change! the chilly appearance of yesterday is
today sunshine. A fresh sylva, besprinkled with flowers,
smiles to our joy, and birds wheel on happy wings, pouring
their hearts into dulcet music, and loving zephyrs come to
woo the tender growth.</p>

<p>In 1877 Arn Olson, a native of Norway, made a perambulation
of the country lying east of Stanwood with the
object in view of finding a suitable bit of ground for a home,
arriving where Cedarhome now smiles he resolved to pitch
his permanent lot among the green bushes. Almost simultaneously,
Martin Larsen, a Norwegian by birth, braved the
interior, remained one year, then located on the Stanwood
flat, three miles north of the city.</p>

<p>It was not until the following year that Cedarhome commenced
to echo the presence of white men. Before only a
faint sound now and then rose to indicate human existence.
Among the first who anchored their fortunes at this place was
John Anderson, who left Sweden in 1869 for Chicago, but was
soon seized with a whim to see and try other climes. Both
South and West were fields of attraction, and to satisfy his
romantic nature he took in the whole country. In 1876 he
stood in the city of Seattle gazing with wonder at the novelties
about him. A reconnoissance of Salmon Bay hit his
liking, but shortly after settled on 160 acres of land at Cedarhome,
then called Burn.</p>

<p>Mr. John Anderson may be rightly termed the father of
Cedarhome, and yet, though his flowing beard has silvered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to a halo of snow, he contributes the fall of his life to daily
duties.</p>

<p>August Anderson has passed through experiences not
dissimilar to those of John Anderson. He, too, was born in
Sweden, came to America in his prime of life, and in 1879
cast his lot in the forest. He has shared the ups-and-downs
of frontier struggles, always a faithful supporter of the Methodist
church.</p>

<p>Andrew Gustaf Bergquist made his appearance a few
months subsequent to the arrival of John and August Anderson.
He is a native of Sweden, where he spent his boyhood,
but like thousands of others sought the New World. Mr.
Bergquist has been alert to the interests of the community,
educationally and morally. For years he has been a member
of the school board.</p>

<p>Now, gloomy loneliness! where art thine "blues and
longings?" No jollier crowd beneath the blue roof of
heaven than a bunch of pioneers. Buoyant in spirit, strong
at arms, the forest fell to their axes. Trails were swamped
and cabins erected to their comforts.</p>

<p>Cohorts of eager land-seekers from all climes perambulated
wealthy vales and green-besprinkled knolls, and among
these was P. O. Norman, who had landed in Seattle, 1881,
but spent two years reconnoitering the coast ere he located
at Cedarhome.</p>

Love of work and progress is the spur of a new country.
As population increased so did the burden of responsibility
augment. Morality and education could not be neglected.
Mr. Norman contributed from his fund of experience and
learning, acquired in his native country, Sweden, and in the
state of Nebraska where he had served as school trustee and
county commissioner.</p>

<p>A craving had manifested for a union of worship, and
in 1883 a Methodist congregation was organized, forming
a circuit with Seattle. Rev. Andrew Farrell was called as
pastor, who expounded the gospel in the two places on alternate
Sundays. In 1888 Mr. Norman drew up a petition
citing for a separation from Seattle and the formation of a
circuit with Skagit. The petition was granted by the bishop,
and the Rev. O. E. Olander was secured as clergyman.</p>

<p>Absolute independence has always been the longing of
the soul. The congregation was now ripe for a divorce from
Skagit, which was granted, 1890, and a beautiful church was
built, which stands as a pride to the village. The Methodist
doctrine has proven relishing, and credit is due to the following
faithful workers: P. O. Norman, John Anderson, August
Anderson, Andrew G. Bergquist, John Lovegren, N. G. Carlson,
W. M. Anderson, N. O. Ekstran, Magnus Haglund, Andrew
Olson and John Olson.</p>

<p>The most promising feature of a church is a healthy,
wide-awake Young People's Society. Not only as an instrumentality
to invite to share the glory in Heaven, but to cultivate
literature and music, to cherish each others peculiarities
and trend of thoughts. These societies are not exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
for the blooms of a few springs, often lingering fall with hoary
hair wields the guiding staff. The most eloquent and active
supporter of the Young People's Society at this place is John
Lovegren, though he has blushed about twelve summers of
matrimonial happiness. Of course, others have scattered
sunbeams, and without their appellation the narrative would
not be complete. William M. Anderson has filled the presidential
chair, and Misses Minnie Johnson, Annie Anderson,
Alice Carlson, Annie, Lizzie and Emma Yngve, Minnie
Bergquist, Mabel Peterson, Annie and Jennie Olson, and Mrs.
Edith Dacke have graced the organization with sweet music
and poetry. Messrs. Andrew Bergquist, A. P. Dacke, Charley
Edeen, John Carlson and Walter Jensen have contributed
able assistance.</p>

<p>The Cedarhome Literary Society, which has been in
existence about three years, has scattered literary light
through the community. The organizers and star members
are: E. C. Nicklason, J. H. Swanson, Thomas Munson, J. C.
Jensen, Charley and Axel Ek, Eric, Mannie and Eddie
Lindstrom, Iver and Simon Olson, Jacob and Andrew Settre,
Andrew Olson, Kettle Levison, Lewis Sandstrom, Eddie, Eli
and Ove Eliason, and Andrew Anderson. The willing participants
among the ladies are: Misses Minnie Nicklason, Mary
Jensen, Hilma and Hulda Ek, and Josie Settre.</p>

No pioneer has endured more hardship than Mathias
Munson, a native of Norway. For thirty-five years he dashed
on the merciless waves from port to port, finally making his
home in the wilderness of Washington. Six-and-four scores of
years rested on his shoulders at his death, one year ago, yet
strong and lively. He was an example of courage and endurance,
and is said to have saved many lives during his sea-faring
years.</p>

<p>Ole Jensen, born and educated in Denmark, bid farewell
to his mother country seventeen years ago, landed in Seattle
and shortly after settled at Cedarhome. "To do and dare"
was his motto; the huge forest fell, and a nice home smiles to
his comfort. John Olson also arrived at Cedarhome about
seventeen years ago. He is a native of Sweden and has
devoted most of his time to farming, being a prominent member
of the Methodist church.</p>

<p>Cedarhome is no longer a nucleus of yearning bachelors,
but a thrifty town surrounded by gardens and meadows.
Three religious denominations are strongly represented, the
Methodists, previously mentioned, the Baptists and the
Lutherans.</p>

<p>G. Nicklason, a pioneer of the Skagit valley and a popular
merchant of Cedarhome, was born in Sweden, but left his
native country at the twilight of manhood. After filling
sundry vocations of hardship in the east, his attention was
drawn to the Pacific, settling in the Skagit valley, 1876, where
he labored hard clearing land and farming. A beautiful farm
in that locality bespeaks his industry. In 1890 he moved to
Cedarhome to engage in general merchandise&mdash;business of his
liking&mdash;in which he has proved himself a master. The fertile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
forest awakened acute calculation in his mind, and in company
with Carl O. Walters started a lumber factory capable of
turning out both lumber and shingle. Mr. Nicklason is a
man of energy and ability, honest and strictly attentive to
business.</p>

<p>Carl O. Walters, G. Nicklason's partner in lumber manufacturing,
was born in Gottland, Sweden, May 27, 1855,
where he received his education, graduated from the public
schools at the age of fifteen. For three years he served in
the navy of Sweden, spent two years traveling in his native
country for the purpose of studying the natural resources and
the varied conditions. The sea was a pleasing attraction to
him; visited all the countries of Europe, and at the age of
twenty-two embarked a ship for the New World, sailed for
some time on the Atlantic coast, rounded Cape Horn, and
landed in the Golden Gate, 1877. He dashed on the waves up
the coast as far as British Columbia. After eight years of
navigation he stept ashore, engaged in carpentry, worked in
Seattle and British Columbia, most of the time as contractor.
In the latter place he spent considerable time prospecting for
coal, employed by the Vancouver Coal Co. Twelve years ago
he located at Cedarhome, turned his attention to farming
served as deputy county assessor, and gradually drifted into
lumber and shingle business, an occupation congenial to
mechanical ingenuity, which is Mr. Walters' forte, being born
with mechanical aptitude as well as with social and conversational
endowments.</p>

L. G. Hanson, the present deputy county assessor, was
born in Skone, Sweden, 1855, emigrated to America in early
manhood, 1882. After some years of ups-and-downs in the
south, he planted his fortune at Cedarhome, nine years ago,
and has ever since taken an active part in public improvements.
He has been a stanch supporter of the public schools
and an advocate for good roads. For years he has served as
school director and road supervisor, and in 1899 he was appointed
deputy county assessor.</p>

<p>E. O. Yngve, a man of affluence and influence in his
native country, Sweden, crossed the salty billows for America
ten years ago. He has been alert to the interest of his adopted
country, and always glad to usher the welfare of his people to
the front.</p>

<p>Frank A. Peterson is likewise a man cut out for frontier
life where energy and strong arms are required. He is a
native of Sweden, but came to South Dakota in his early days,
stayed there for some years, and in 1886 landed in Seattle, and
two years later joined his countrymen at Cedarhome. He has
been awake to the interest of the public schools and the welfare
of the community in general; for years he has been a
member of the school board. His brother John is also a good
citizen.</p>

John Ek, too, belongs to the category of frontier soldiers
who delight in converting the forest into fields of gold and
smiling gardens. He was born in Sweden and came to Cedarhome,
1890. Round the village live a number of good citizens
and industrious farmers; viz., Oluf Johnson, Sivert Wold,
Rasmus Settre, K. K. Erdahl, N. O. Lindstrom, P. G. Johnson,
Olof Anderson, Levi Levison, Ole Johnson, Robert Johnson,
P. L. Anderson, Ole Husby, Erik Johnson, P. M. Arentzen,
C. P. Hemmingsen, A. Evenson, B. Evenson, and others.
Aaron Larson, a native of Sweden, who resides on a pleasant
ranch about three miles east of Cedarhome, is a highly accomplished
musician. His daughter Cora is likewise displaying
extraordinary talents for divine strains.</p>

<p>The Skagit valley is a stretch of inexhaustible fertility,
commencing at the mouth of the river and running northward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
for scores of miles, and spreads out, east and west, into
a plain beautifully embellished with proud farms, and mostly
populated with Scandinavians. Six miles up the river rests
the town of Fir, a bustling village, surrounded by a rich
farming community. Ole J. Borseth is the leading business
man of the town, who located here, 1883, and in 1891 engaged
in general merchandise. He is a native of Norway, where he
was bred and educated.</p>

<p>Knut H. Opdal, also born in Norway, arrived in 1888,
and shortly afterward embarked in hotel business. He and
his wife are representatives of Norse simplicity and integrity,
imbued with love for their native country, and patriotic and
loyal to the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>J. F. Anderson was one of the first settlers. He was born
in Sweden, left his native land during the early summer of
maturity, and located in the state of Iowa. In 1874 he landed
in Port Townsend on Prince Alfred, and immediately proceeded
to the Skagit valley, settling on North Fork. After a
year of hard work he moved with his family to Seattle in
order to give his children the advantages of good schooling.
At the close of six years they returned to the Skagit, locating
on South Fork, where Fir now stands. In 1883 a flood rushed
over the country, swept along everything save some stubborn
buildings, the crop was destroyed, and havoc spread in all
directions. "Never give in," says the sage, which is applicable
to Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Anderson. "Onward" was their
motto, and two beautiful homes shine to their honest efforts&mdash;
one at Seattle and one at Fir. Their children, who are now
combating with the turmoils of the world, are well educated
and highly respected. Jennie is married and lives in Seattle;
Axel and Eric are connected with the Polson and Wilson
Hardware Co., established in Seattle and La Conner; Victor
is married to an esteemed lady, Miss Marie Paulson, and
runs the farm; Minnie is postmistress at Fir and a teacher
of music, Howard sleeps in the grave, and Otto stays home.</p>

Andrew N. Crogstad, a leading citizen, a man of honor
and intelligence, has shared the difficulties of the frontier.
He was born in Trondhjem, Norway, 1852, received a good
schooling and in February, 1872, left his fatherland for Dunn
county, Wisconsin, and five years later disembarked in the
Skagit valley. He turned his attention to logging and farming.
A beautiful farm, surrounded by a wealthy orchard,
stands as a pride to his energy. He has seen days of romantic
awfulness, once hazardous, but now pleasing reminiscences.
The flood has always been a dread, and many frights has it
caused. One Fourth of July Mr. Crogstad went to Fir to
celebrate the independence of his adopted country. The
morning was bright and prognostic of a pleasant time. Returning
home during gray twilight, a seething, rolling sound
floated down on the breeze, and ere they realized the cause,
water crept up to their feet. The ladies were frightened out
of their wits and took to screaming, which seems to be their
only alternative in time of danger. Mr. Crogstad and his
companion understood the predicament, slung the ladies on
their backs and pranced home, thus avoiding a disastrous
outcome.</p>

In 1887 he was married to an estimable lady, Miss Wilhelmina
Augusta Jensen, born in Scleswig, Holstein, 1863, of
Danish parentage, and came to America, 1875. They have
five children, four girls and one boy; Alvina, Emma, Lottie,
Clara and Maurice.</p>

<p>One not accustomed to pioneer life in the forest can
hardly conceive its many romantic features. To live on the
bank of a big river, rolling and moaning in tireless monotony,
and huge trees praying and howling to the wroth of the wind,
and frisky brutes gamboling in wild frolics, and Indians
skulking in stealthy moods, is something awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>On a jolly morning, Charles Mann, the pioneer merchant
of Fir, reconnoitered in the woods behind his store, and to his
awe, stumbled into a hideous infernal, which was afterwards
discovered to be an Indian cemetery. Ah, terror! hundreds
of Indians were hanging in the trees, some nude skeletons,
some with the hearts torn out of their mutilated frames; owls
and crows were sailing on evil wings among the ghastly dead,
and horror seemed to reign in every bush. This finding
startled the whole town, and into the woods rushed young and
old; flames sprang into the air and swept through the forest,
and the dead Indians dropped from a hanging hell into a
burning one.</p>

<p>The flood of 1887 spread consternation throughout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
community. The water leaped down from the mountains in
savage fury and scattered the dykes to the briny billows, busy
hugging the beach below. Houses set sailing down the valley
in tipsy joltings, and logs went chasing each other in mad
bewilderment for the sea. The deluge broke into Mann's
store and rose to the depth of three feet. Mr. Mann was alone
in the store, and to drive away loneliness grabbed the fish line
and commenced angling, caught two mountain trouts by the
counter. During the same flood Mrs. Mann was sitting in
the Fir Hotel chatting with some friends, and before they
were aware of the enormity of the water they went sailing on
their chairs around the room.</p>

<p>In and around Fir live a number of Scandinavians who
have witnessed frontier encounters, but their early struggles
have become pleasing revels for a fanciful imagination, as the
late years have crowned their efforts with success. Olof
Polson, a son of Sweden, and at present mayor of La Conner,
was along with the first brigade of pioneers that scattered
themselves in the valley. Ole Lonke, born in Norway, and a
prosperous farmer, about a mile from Fir, located here over
twenty years ago. Ole Johnson, also a native of Norway, has
resided here over two decades, and Peter Olson dates his
arrival still further back.</p>

<p>Among the more recent settlers who have proved valuable
exponents are: John Hanson, August Johnson, Even
Handstad, John Kragnes, Ole Kvande, Knut Lange, Sivert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Sande, Ole Olson, Lars Engen, G. O. Branstad, Lars and
Nils Danielson and Elik Johnson.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the river we find many Scandinavian
pioneers who rank among the most prominent citizens; viz.,
Peter Egtvet, Ole N. Lee, Frank Tollefson and Magnus
Anderson. At Skagit City, N. Erickson, Alfred, Edwin and
Herman Johnson are representative farmers who have spared
no time for the upbuilding of the country. Rev. John Johnson,
presiding elder of the Swedish Methodist church, who resides
at this place, is a noted man, being a gifted rhetorician and
an able pulpit orator.</p>

<p>To the east of this happy village spreads out a fertile
plain which sweeps up into a proud elevation, called Pleasant
Ridge, the home of the old pioneer, Charles John Chilberg, and
two of his sons, Isaac and James. Here we find also a number
of other Scandinavians who have shared the burden of
early struggles.</p>

<p>Four miles up the river from Skagit City stands the jolly
city of Mt. Vernon, which has within its boundary many
prominent men from the shores of Norway and Sweden. The
two leading merchants of the city are Norwegians&mdash;Louis Foss
and N. J. Moldstad.</p>

Louis Foss is well known throughout the Pacific country,
being the first Scandinavian state senator in Washington. He
was born in Norway, 1849, received a liberal education, graduated
from college at nineteen, and shortly after emigrated to
America, locating in Wisconsin. He worked four years as
scaler of logs on Chippewa river; went to the Dakota Black
Hills during the excitement of 1875, where he remained two
years working in the mines. From whence he went to Zumbrota,
Minnesota, to assume the management of a large merchandise
store, in which capacity he labored faithfully for five years.
His name had acquired a favorable clang among the people and
the city of Fosston was christened to his honor. In 1887
he disposed of his interests in Minnesota and moved to
Tacoma, Washington, where he engaged in real estate, and
entered mercantile business at Mt. Vernon and Buckley. Five
years later he was elected state senator from Pierce county,
and served his state with honor for four years. At the expiration
of his senatorship he removed with his family to Mt.
Vernon, where he now resides, and owns a big mercantile
establishment, The Fair. He has also a large store of similar
kind in Anacortes which his eldest son is managing. Mr.
Foss is not only a man of business aptitude, but also a man of
character, fidelity and honor.</p>

N. J. Moldstad merits the appellation of "progressive
business man." He was born in Vestre Toten, Norway,
April 1, 1863, where he obtained his early education. July 2,
1876, he sailed for America, settling at De Forest, Wisconsin,
and shortly after entered his brother's dry goods store. His
next move was to Lanesborough, Minnesota, where he secured
a clerkship with a big mercantile firm, afterwards assumed
a similar vocation in Minneapolis. From whence
he turned his attention to North Dakota, embarking in store
and banking business for himself. The Pacific had become a
fascinating field, sold out, and crossed the Rocky, locating in
Tacoma, where he established a shoe store. Another journey
seemed to emphasize business progress, disposed of his establishment
in Tacoma and engaged in dry goods and clothing in
Mt. Vernon. The last years he has also given due consideration
to the Alaska gold fields, being interested in several
claims around Dawson. In 1893 he took a trip to Europe,
traveled in England, France, Germany and the Scandinavian
countries. In 1898 he was married to an estimable lady in
Mt. Vernon, and spent his honeymoon journeying in California,
the Southern states and New York, visited Washington
and shook hands with President McKinley. On returning
took in Chicago and other large cities. Mr. Moldstad is a
republican in politics and has been delegate to county and
state conventions, but has scoffed at the idea of seeking any
office. He is like Mr. Louis Foss, of the same city, in being
a true gentleman, respected and respectable.</p>

<h2>SCANDINAVIANS IN BELLINGHAM BAY.<br />
<a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span></a></h2>

<p>It is but few places where nature has been so kind and
lavishing with her store of grandeur as in Bellingham Bay.
Sweet in music, the happy ripples dance to kiss the pebbled
borders of the twin cities&mdash;New Whatcom and Fairhaven.
Above the din of their tumults stands the white-haired Mt.
Baker with a snowy hood drawn down his broad shoulders,
throwing glimpses of awe over a gay landscape. About four
miles from these sister cities smiles Lake Whatcom, where
living gondolas ride on its glassy bosom from shore to shore.</p>

<p>In early days Scandinavians gave heed to this happy land
of verdure and songs. About forty years ago they visited
the bay and reconnoitered the country. Everson, a Norwegian
by birth, was among the first pioneers. The last ten years a
number of Norwegians, Swedes and Danes have located in
both New Whatcom and Fairhaven, and rank among the
leading business men of the two cities.</p>

<p>O. B. Barba, a prominent lawyer of New Whatcom, born
in Norway, but raised and educated in Wisconsin, came here,
1890, and has steadily invited the confidence of his countrymen
and the people in general.</p>

<p>Ole Oien has the honor of being the first Scandinavian
elected to county office in Whatcom county. He was born in
Toten, Norway, came to Bellingham Bay several years ago,
and at the last election was chosen to the office of county
clerk. He is a man of energy and intelligence, and may
rise to higher trust and honor in the gift of the people.</p>

Olaf Udness and Charley Erholm, the former born in
Norway and the latter in Finland, emigrated here, 1889.
They are proprietors of the Pacific Steam Laundry, and
prominent in business and social circles.</p>

<p>Thomas Dahlquist, a native of Sweden, and one of the
leading grocers in New Whatcom, landed in Bellingham Bay,
1889, and has gained the esteem of all the people. His wife
was born in Norway and is regarded as the foremost Scandinavian
lady in the city.</p>

<p>John Larsen, owner of the only first-class music store in
Bellingham Bay, is an able business man. His wife is an
influential member of the Norwegian Synod church.</p>

<p>A. G. Wickman, born in Sweden, cast his eye for the
first time over Bellingham Bay, August 2, 1889. He is a
man of keen intellect and sound judgment, and possesses the
air of a true gentleman. He is a merchant tailor and enjoys
a lucrative business.</p>

<p>P. Osberg and George Martinsen are well-known contractors,
the firm being Osberg and Martinsen. My pen
would not be true to these gentlemen without the following
assertion: "Osberg and Martinsen's ingenious work has
commanded technical honor to the Scandinavians."</p>

<p>P. Jacobsen, a son of Denmark, is likewise a man of
mechanical aptitude. He is a skillful blacksmith and a true
gentleman.</p>

<p>In Fairhaven we find many popular Scandinavians, men
who are held in high esteem by the people. Rev. T. J. Moen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
is one who enjoys the respect and love of the community.
He was born in Talgen, Norway, where he received his early
education. In 1879 he graduated from Hamar Seminarium,
among the highest in scholarship, and two years later emigrated
to America, where he secured a position as teacher of
religion. His ambition was to be a minister of the gospel,
and in 1889 entered Augsburg Seminarium, spent one year in
the academic department, then stept into the theological college
and graduated with honor after three years of diligent
study. He came to New Whatcom seven years ago as pastor
of the United Lutheran church, and has met with success
in his responsible vocation.</p>

traces his birthplace to Norway. He came to this city ten
years ago, worked for others at first, but now owns a paying
establishment.</p>

<p>Gust. Linden, a native of Sweden, O. M. C. Henning and
Chris. Keel, born in Norway, have been in Fairhaven since
1890, and have worked themselves up from meager circumstances
to affluence and honor. They are representatives of
the industrial classes, possessed of mechanical ingenuity and
prominent members of the Lutheran church.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henning, wife of O. M. C. Henning, is a woman of
learning and elevated character, being an energetic worker in
the United Lutheran church. Her oldest daughter, Mrs.

On a sunny slope slowly rising from the merry sheet of
golden water, stands the town of Poulsbo, in Kitsap county,
about twenty-five miles northwest from Seattle. A smiling
tongue of the Sound is rippling into the land, and here and
there a green nose is pushing itself into the brine as trying to
contest with the elements of the deep. Sweet melodies spring
from the laughing ripples, and sail on the wings of lazy
zephyrs to cheer the ears of the village. This musical bay is
a natural abode for Scandinavians who are wont to the songs of
happy fjords. As early as 1875, Ole Stubb stranded his skiff
on the shore of this vocal stretch for permanent nestling. He
was born in Norway, and has witnessed days of divers
struggles, interlaced with days of sunshine.</p>

<p>A year later Fred Landstone pinned his lot to a piece of
land about ten miles east of Poulsbo, and in 1883 Jorgen Eliason
was attracted to the bay, and has ever since been instrumental
in shaping the affairs of the community. He is a native of
Norway, landed in Michigan, 1870, and has proved himself a
man of honor and intellectual capacity, a true representative
of Norse simplicity and manhood. I. B. Moe arrived simultaneously
and has been a potent factor in a multitude of
enterprises.</p>

<p>Torge Jensen, a prominent citizen of Poulsbo, a man of
integrity and intelligence, was a member of the early brigade
of pioneers. He was born in Norway and came to Poulsbo
from South Dakota. He has been one of the foremost men to
look after the interest of the place, educationally and otherwise.</p>

Nils Olson, also of Norse birth, merits a footing among
the first settlers and deserves the encomium due a man of
honesty and noble aims.</p>

<p>Among the business men of Poulsbo, Adolph Hostmark
carries the honor of being the first merchant. He erected a
store fifteen years ago, and conducted a general merchandise
establishment until his death. Some years subsequent Lars
Christensen engaged in mercantile business and his career
has been an uninterrupted success, characteristic of industry
and uprightness.</p>

<p>Lars Christensen was born in Thisted, Denmark, 1844,
received a common school education, spent years on a large
plantation as foreman and assistant manager. In 1872 he
emigrated to America, selecting Marquette, Michigan, as his
favorable place for dwelling. He worked on the docks and
at other manual labor until 1875, when he migrated to Brookings
county, South Dakota, where he engaged in farming. After
twelve years of varied experiences on the Dakota prairies he
turned his attention to the Pacific, arriving in Poulsbo, 1887,
where he embarked in clearing land and ranching. A beautiful
place in the heart of the smiling villa bespeaks his pluck and
industry. In 1893 he launched into general merchandise,
which he later converted into a dry goods store. Mr. Christensen
has always been a prominent member of the Lutheran
church and a true republican in politics, and in every walk of
life a loyal citizen, honest, intelligent and respected. He was
married to an estimable lady in Denmark. They have one
son, C. P. Christensen, who was born in Denmark, 1868, and
came to America with his parents. He has inherited the
traits of a noble father and mother and ranks among the best
of men, endowed with a fine intellect and moral integrity.</p>

<p>Poulsbo has achieved what no other community on the
coast has ventured to do. While the villa was in its early
embryo a knot of pioneers organized and incorporated the
Poulsbo Wharf and Storage Company, and built a substantial
dock and warehouse, accessible by any steamer.</p>

<p>The first steamer that cleaved the bosom of the deep between
Poulsbo and Seattle was the Quickstep, owned by John
J. Hansen, who later built Hattie Hansen. But to burst the
chains of monopolized transportation, and to usher pecuniary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
relief to the toiling farmers, a sprinkling of valorous hearts,
headed by Thomas Hegdahl and Nils Olson, perfected the
organization of the Poulsbo-Colby Transportation Company,
and built the beautiful steamer&mdash;Advance&mdash;which plies daily
between Poulsbo and Seattle.</p>

<p>The following are officers of the Poulsbo-Colby Transportation
Company; J. A. McPherson, President; Peter
Erlandson, Vice-president; C. P. Christensen, Secretary;
L. Christensen, Treasurer; J. W. Russell, Manager.</p>

<p>Poulsbo has had its religious upheavals but aside from
these fanatical revolutions it has scattered seeds of Christian
principles. A fine Lutheran church tops a pleasant hillock as
evidence of this statement. Rev. I. Tollefsen was summoned to
the bay as the first gospel expounder who unveiled the gems
of the Old Book according to Augsburgian theology. Into
his footsteps dropped Rev. H. Langeland who is yet a beloved
representative of the Supreme Being in the charming town of
Poulsbo. Many of the trance reports which have taken speedy
wings for other climes have not been absolutely true. In
justice to Rev. H. Langeland my pen cannot evade the declaration
that he is a gentleman and a true Christian.</p>

<p>The Orphans' Home, organized eight years ago, looms
magnificently on a nicely trimmed knoll, overlooking a wizard
landscape. Rev. Tollefsen is the father of the institution, but
the people in general have given to it their unreserved support.</p>

<p>During recent years, Poulsbo has made quick strides
forward, no less than four stores and two hotels combine to
signalize its progress. Langeland and Eliason are thrifty
grocers; Alf Hostmark conducts an establishment of similar
nature; Thos. Hegdahl is a prosperous furniture dealer and
L. Christensen a dry goods merchant. The farmers around
Poulsbo have tendered ready hands to any project tending to
advance the interest of their villa. Steiner Thoreson and T. Paulson
have been active exponents in the divers avenues of melioration,
and A. V. Paulson, an ex-teacher of the public schools,
has never been lagging when a new enterprise was to be
rooted. Ole Thompson, A. Talakson, A. O. Hagan, Chris.
Williams and Ole Nelson figure among the early settlers.
They are thrifty farmers and have contributed their time and
energy for the good of the community. Nils Atleson, though
recent colonist, has shared the burden of pushing the place to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the front. He is the leader of the United Lutheran church,
and a man of intelligence and pluck. K. G. Steen and others
have also proved worthy factors where skill and energy shine
pre-eminently.</p>

<p>The country surrounding Poulsbo is mostly peopled with
Scandinavians. Pearson, across the bay, is a thriving community,
principally settled with intelligent Swedes, who have
spared no time to make their terra firma attractive.</p>

<p>Breidablik, the home of the Paulson family, is an inviting
place. As we recede further from Poulsbo we come to Seabold
where many Scandinavians breathe happiness and prosperity.
A short distance from this village lives C. Sanders, who was
born in Sweden and came to Port Madison thirty-five years ago.
There are also other old settlers as A. M. Anderson and Chas.
Olson. Across a pleasant elevation of land slowly falling to
the sea we find the flower-besprinkled Rollingbay, where some
early pioneers contend happily with the wild billows of the
world. Martin Sunnes, Dona Falk, Andrew Sornsen, Nils
Peterson, Peter Bye, T. Siverson, Mrs. Hanna Johnson and C.
Johnson were the first adventurers.</p>

<p>There are other scattered Scandinavian settlements, but
let it suffice, for this volume, by taking a step to Shelton,
Mason county. Here we find the well-known Professor G. B.
Gunderson and other prominent Scandinavians. Prof. Gunderson
has served the people of his county as superintendent
of the public schools and as representative in the legislature,
with marked ability and success.</p>
